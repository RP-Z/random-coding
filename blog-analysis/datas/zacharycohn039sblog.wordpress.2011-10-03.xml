		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today was great. Woke up a bit late, which wasn't so good, but from there I went slacklining, took a calc test, then went to Taekwondo. Donning my sparring gear once more (first time in ~3 months) was a near religious experience. Had 5 matches, 2 against white belts, 1 red belt, and two black belts. I was very impressed with (everyone, but especially) the black belts. Looks like there's going to be some seriously kickass sparring matches this year. I've lost a bit of my speed and flexibility, but I think I mostly just need to knock the rust off of me and I'll be back in the groove.<br /><br />Invented a new "takedown" today... accidentally. As one of the <br />blackbelts was coming up for a roundhouse to the head, I was  doing a spinning hook kick. My leg wrapped around his, and my spinning inertia took us to the ground. We both rolled away and got up quickly, but it was very interesting. And then the other blackbelt match was one of the best matches I've ever had. We were both tired, we had 30 seconds, and we were both going 110%.  I quoted Casablanca, "... I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship." Definitely good times.<br /><br />Headed to the Commons for food (Food is always good) and we were trying to explain parkour to someone. Then I saw a gate I had passed at least 4 times a day, every day, all of last year. I saw it with new eyes, and yelled "Impromptu demonstration!" That's my new favorite spot on campus. It's these two trapezoidal shaped gates that are chained together in the middle, so cars can't drive past them. Except it's fantastic for kongs, side vaults, underbars, kong/turn vaults to underbars,  QM, and so much else. Definitely going to be there.. a lot.<br /><br />Then food. Then as I was riding my bike out, I saw the same group of people a bit infront of me (a bunch of these people are coming to my new weekly (or more often) Parkour jams) jumping onto a random rock on the grass. So then I decided to test out my hand (cast had just come off). Lets just say I felt exquisite. I found a picnic table, and was demonstrating kongs, dive<br /> kongs, speed vaults, dashes, precisions, and anything else I could think of. <br /><br />It felt so good to be back in the game. Tomorrow (first 'weekly' <br />jam without my cast) is going to be so awesome. Expect a post about it.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Parkour was good today. The group is quite impressive, really.<br /><br />Today (9.22.07):<br />*Worked on wall passes. People are getting much better, but most people are still using their elbows.<br />*Introduced people to a wider variety of vaults. Taught people kongs and speed vaults, then demonstrated dashes, double kongs, dive kongs, among a few others. A surprising amount of people got the kong down today. And most of the people who didn't will have it next time, I'm sure.<br />*Did some simple precisions onto a rock, demonstrated how to properly come down on an obstacle, especially if it isn't nice and flat (like a rock.. isn't.)<br />*Moved onto the gates. I did a short demo of how techniques can be strung together. I was hoping to get a turn vault to underbar down, but it was too high for a decent turnvault. People drilled underbars, prepping them for later underbar practice.<br />*Precisions onto the stairs. <br />*Practiced some aerials and one handed cartwheels. I ended up doing some sort of bastardized one handed front handspring roundoff.<br />*We lost a few people here, but then gained a few people. We headed down to the SLC and worked on some taller wall passes, and then it got interesting. Hit the jump, as they say, for more details.<br />*We drilled underbars next, hard. We went to the Bookstore, where they have a slanted double rail. I was working on increasing the height on my jump to underbar, and I discovered I need to work on my reverse underbar, because I can't figure out how to come out of it without a broken spine.<br />*We finished up with precisions and rolls at the Kodak quad. I didn't work on my max-distance precision, just a few shorter ones. I tried a running precision, but couldn't get the... precise.. part down. Kept overshooting.<br /><br />Okay. Now for the story. So as we were training at the  (second) wall pass spot, I had noticed a lot of security across the field. (They were setting up/getting ready for a concert tonight) As we began to walk away, I noticed a security guard on an intercept course. I led the group and we kept on walking, when he called out "Hey guys, can I talk with you for a sec." I looked over at him, and pleasantly as I could (while I was thinking "crap crap crap") said "Sure, no problem."<br /><br />Basically, he gave the usual, albiet humourous, speech about if we start climbing, and then smash our face in and lose all our teeth, not ONLY will the girls not find <br />us attractive anymore, but he'll have to call and explain what happened to our mothers. He then asked us what we were doing. I briefly explained parkour (kind of like obstacle coursing, except using just whatever is around. People walk up and see a wall that they have to go around, we see an obstacle to move over.), and said that while I totally understand your reluctance, we didn't just start with this. We started with much smaller walls, and we practiced safe ways to land and fall, and basically that training safely is paramount. After I reiterated this in several different ways, and pointed out that I was just teaching several people the proper way to land, he kind of nodded and I think he understood. He then said, "Alright well.. just be safe." and then I introduced myself, he introduced himself, and we parted on good terms.<br /><br />I'm actually planning on emailing him and thanking him for his understanding, and then inviting him and a few other members of campus safety out to see what we do. I think this is the best course of action. I'm hoping it will show that we're safe and responsible enough to alert them to what is going on, and what we're doing, and perhaps even let them participate, if they want.<br /><br />I think the funniest part of the whole thing was when he was semi-lecturing us, and he was telling us to "think outside the box" (i suppose in terms of safety/what other people are responsible for). I just giggled (silently, to myself) and thought about how we actually WERE thinking outside the box.<br /><br />More details to come in the saga of Campus Safety and RIT Parkour.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have found that improvising is a critical part of the college experience. Whether it's improvising on a paper you're writing, or improvising an excuse on the spot when you've been discovered somewhere you very shouldn't be, thinking on your feet is a very important skill to have.<br /><br />My two latest improvisations come more in the form of lacking something, and having to make up for it. The first instance was when I ran out of bread.<br /><a href="http://www.zaccohn.com/pics/ppbj.jpg">Improvisation #1!</a><br /><br />The second instance, which happened today, occured when I was unable to find my razor blade:<br /><a href="http://www.zaccohn.com/pics/me/shaving1a.jpg">Improvisation #2!</a>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The place of &quot;Go Big or Go Home&quot; in Parkour.</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In short, there is no place for the extreme sports "Go Big or Go Home" attitude in Parkour. <br /><br />When I started "parkour," (i put that in quotes because of the following) I really didn't know what it was all about. I just saw the techniques, I saw the videos, and I went out and did some really stupid stuff that could have seriously injured me. For a little while (and really, a VERY little while) the group I train with were all about "Go big or go home."<br /><br />I realized, pretty quickly (thankfully), that this was not what parkour was about. It isn't "Go big or go home." It isn't the X-Games. It's not about "jumping off of s%@*." I was damn lucky I didn't break both my legs. As it is, I bashed my hip on a screwed up precision (though that wasn't a "go big" thing, it was just sandy and I didn't check my surfaces (ANOTHER lesson learned)), and to this day a year and a half later, it still gets sore if I lay on it for too long.<br /><br />Don't trust me on this. Don't blindly take my word for truth, or lies. Read. Read the articles stickied on the .Net forums. Read the articles on APK. Read the articles on NYPK, Colorado PK, any of the other matured community sites (meaning not www.ihartpkandjumpingoffastuff.com). Read and THINK about it, ponder it, meditate on it - whatever on it - until you realize WHY parkour is not about "go big or go home."<br /><br />I think too quickly seasoned traceurs tell new people that big drops aren't what it's all about, but they don't give any reasons (other than the obvious health/safety reasons which a lot of people apparently don't care about.)<br /><br />In a thread I was reading recently, a new guy was saying he was drilling 10 foot drops - great. Now you know you can do it if you have to. What's the point in doing something THAT risky over and over and over again until you get hurt?<br /><br />A traceur named Hardcoretraceur, whom I really respect, said something at the NYPK07 jam: Someone pointed to a roof and said "Could you jump from that?"<br />He replied "Yes, but I don't want to."<br />Hardcoretraceur believes, and I agree with him, that the best way to train for drops is to do drops. Which means while squats and pistols and whatever else helps condition the legs, nothing conditions them for drops like doing drops.  But he, and I, want to be doing parkour when we're 30. 40. 50. We value our knees, so we stay ground-level. There's no reason to practice jumping off of buildings. If you ever need to, if you train hard enough with low drops, you'll probably be able to make a few big drops without a problem. But if you train a ton of high drops, the damage you're doing is going to prevent you from doing ANYTHING pretty quickly.<br /><br />So please, anyone who is still of the "Go big or go home" attitude: Don't change because I tell you to. Or because M2 tells you to, or Sebastian, or eZ, or David Belle. But do LISTEN to us. Take our advice. The advice of people who have been in your position. And then do your own reading, your own thinking, and keep searching until you find the path to the same conclusion we found.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I wrote this on the train leaving hardcoretraceur's house at 4:45 in the morning the Monday after NYPK. Some of these are inside jokes/references, others are more universal: <br /><br />What I learned at NYPK <br />-Why hardcoretraceur is so hardcore. Or at least stupid. (The shoulder/dragging thing) <br />-Why 3-day jams are both a horrible, and fantastic, idea. <br />-No matter how perfectly things are planned, and how many redundancies are in place, things will still get screwed up. Tough luck. Figure it out and keep on moving. <br />-Accidents and pain happen: It is how one responds to these that matters. <br />-'Nam was "crappy." (Crazy vet on the light rail) <br />-"Don't get high, go do something." (Crazy vet again) <br />-There is something to be learned from _everyone_, regardless of skill, politics, or path. <br />-Be strong to be useful. <br />-Running with the pack is better than staying with the flock. <br />-Make no excuses not to train to your limit. <br />-In order to break the apple, you must first break yourself. <br />-Pyro's shoulder looks like Ravioli. It isn't supposed to, however. <br />-What you put in is what you get out. <br />-When discussing which is worse, slavery or the Holocaust, check for cameras. <br />-With a positive mind, one can have an iron will. <br />-There is always something you can train. <br />-Anyone who suffers from friends who don't support their love for parkour, but train anyway, deserves some serious respect. <br />-Drama, while it should have been left at High School, often isn't. <br />-Try to leave Drama in high school anyway. <br />-Stop talking and move. <br />-And my last quote, which I've decided is my new personal motto: Once you hit rock bottom, start chiselling.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Artem, Bryce and I ran the Urbanathlon in NYC this past weekend. It was pretty great.<br /><br />We drove down to Artem's house in New Jersey, dropped some stuff off, and then took a train to NYC. We got to the gym to pick up our registration packets at 7:40, and saw Jessie/Hardcoretraceur, X, and M1l3s there. We hung out outside the gym for a while, then split ways and headed towards Artem's grandparents house in Brooklyn. <br /><br />All I can say is: Goddamn can Russians cook. And goddamn DO Russians cook. We must have eaten two or three meals in the... 2 hours we were there and not sleeping. <br /><br />Got to sleep at 11:30, then woke up at 3:30 to hop on the train to Manhattan. We all got to our places with varying degrees of fail (Artem took the express train by accident, the train I needed was closed so I had to walk, Bryce missed one of his trains), and then the race began! Artem ran the first leg of the race, and did quite well, running a 22 minute 5k, including the time it took to pass the obstacles (Jersey barriers, climbing through tubes). He passed me the timing chip, and I took off. Passed my obstacles with absolutely no difficulty. I was actually a little bit disappointed in how easy they were (Scaffolding maze, Marine hurdles). I passed off to Bryce, who took off up the 52 flights of stairs in World Trade Center Building 7. He completed those in 13 minutes. Absolutely amazing. We actually missed him on the way down, because we didn't expect him to do them that quickly.<br /><br />We all met up again at the finish line, where Jessie and I took to playing with the taxis hurdles and the 8ft wall climb. We got a nice shot of us simultaneously konging the taxis (I actually slipped and had to roll on the concrete, which worked out well), and then we flew over the wall, much to the surprise of the marines milling about.<br /><br />Afterwards, the six of us met up with Pyro and Exo, and we went to central park to play Ultimate Frisbee. Then our team went back to NJ, ate about thirty pounds of Russian food, and then passed out. <br /><br />It was a great weekend. Next year, we're running it all solo. And actually training for it a lot more (broken bones are not conducive to training).]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The first rule of Hell Night...</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Thursday night I went out with Mike and Charlie, and we did a test run of Hell Night, which is basically going to be a 2-3 hour strength/conditioning/endurance session using Parkour style movements. There is shimmying, crawling, climbing, jumping, carrying, running. There are group activities and solo ones. The name was borrowed from the British traceur Blane, and the concept is adapted to fit the campus here at Rochester Institute of Technology.<br /><br />The goal of Hell Night is more than just conditioning the body and the mind; the goal of Hell Night is to break you. Once you are broken - physically, mentally - you can progress to a new level.  It is night: it is dark, cold, often will be wet, and you will be tired. People are capable of amazing things, but they do not think they are. If people can push themselves to what they believe is the brink of their physical capabilities, and then farther... That is when people begin to understand who they are. What they are capable of. I want people to develop an iron will, an unwillingness to give up. Once you are broken, then keep going... that is when you prove to youself that you can handle anything.<br /><br />A preview of Hell Night. This is by no means even a small part of the total experience:<br />2x - Piggyback rides (or maybe fireman's carry) a partner up and down a hill.<br />2x - Crab walk up stairs, quadrupedal movement (QM) down.<br />2x - Bridge walk down between wall and handicap ramp, cathang the other side and shimmy up the other side of the ramp.<br />1x - Indian Wall Sits (everyone does a wallsit, the person in back gets up, runs across the thighs of everyone else, wallsits in the front. Rinse, wipe hands on pants, repeat until end of wall, about 100ft later)<br />1x - Cliffhanger (grab onto ledge, shimmy horizontally without a wall to touch against)<br />5x - Traverse from one side of playground to another without touching the ground.<br />1x - 1/6th mile QM through the woods. Emphasis on being as silent as possible.<br />2.5x - Precision jump from rock to rock, and then back, that's one lap. There are 43 rocks.<br /><img src="http://www.zaccohn.com/port/pics/parkour/full/precisionTraining.jpg" /><br />3x - Climb in a circle around tree, from branch to branch, using only arms.<br /><br />Hell Night will evolve over time. Once winter really hits, there will be many changes to take advantage of the new enviroment (slippery surfaces, ice, snow). No two Hell Nights will be the same.<br /><br />After the run through (which was closer to a full workout than a test run), I went back to the gym to get my bag. The receptionist said "Have a good workout."<br /><br />I just smiled.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today was Attempt #2 at the Campus Safety Jam, but the officer we were supposed to meet up with got caught up in "a dispute" (so said Dispatch. I almost offered to help out. "Hey, I'm looking for a rumble, how can we help?), and he couldn't make it.  Oh well, maybe... eventually.<br /><br />Still a good jam though. (Getting cold and windy though...) A few new people, everyone's making very good progress. We took another lap on the rocks (picture in a precvious post), and it is such a fantastic workout. Thank you, Rochester Institute of Technology, for putting those rocks there. They actually recently added 2, just for us! (Or so I will continue to believe.) Tim and I were drilling this tic-tac over a raised brick grate which isn't really that hard, but if you slip on the wall you could fall onto a smaller brick structure and hurt yourself, or you might just land on it coming out of the tic-tac. After a few dry-runs with spotters, we finally nailed it. We also came up with an idea for a tic-tac off of a wall into a turn vault, although we want to test it a few times somewhere that doesn't have a ledge on the other side of the rail, so if we miss it'll be okay.<br /><br />Tomorrow we're going into downtown Rochester to Manhattan Square Park. It might rain, which won't stop me, but it wouldn't be quite as much fun so I hope it doesn't.<br /><br />Philadelphia Jam is next weekend, we've got about 5 or 6 people heading down for that. (Oh yeah, Dad, I'm going to Philly next weekend.) A number of the NYPK guys are going, so it's going to be a good chance to see them again. I'm hoping some people from the Mid-Atlantic region come up too, get a good quad-state jam going.<br /><br />In my own personal news, I got my standing backtuck down on Wednesday. Pretty happy about that. Landing isn't 100%, but I'm pretty sure it was just because I was tired. Going to train it some more tomorrow or Monday, I think. Should be fun. I'll get a video (or pictures! Those would be funny...) up once I get a chance.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The first official Hell Night was tonight. It was great. Seven people showed up, and we dragged in an eighth that we saw walking by. I know of one other person who just couldn't show up today, and we found at least two people who might be interested in joining us in the process. So I'm calling it a success.<br /><br />We met up, warmed up a bit, and then got started. Two of the other guys had been to my planning session, but no one else had any idea what was in store for them... After the warmup, we started with this:<br /><img src="http://www.zaccohn.com/pics/hell/crabqmstairs.jpg" alt="parkour rochester"><br /><br />Crab walk up, backwards, move over a flight of stairs, and then QM down. Rinse, wipe hands on pants, repeat until out of rows of stairs.<br /><br />Other popular favorites included grabbing on to a handrail and wrapping your feet over it, hanging underneath, and then crawling up. Wouldn't be too hard... except for the vertical support poles you have to go around. It was some serious work, but it was fun.<br /><br />The Indian Wall Sits were good too. About a 75ft stretch of wall, sit with your legs at 90 degree angles, and your back pressed against the wall. The person at the end of the line stands up, runs across everyones thighs, goes back to position. Repeat until the end of the wall.<br /><br />There was a lot of QMing. Up stairs, down stairs, up hills, down hills, through the woods (That's a personal favorite of mine. About 1/5th of a mile path through the woods. Get down on your hands and feet, and crawl as SILENTLY as you can, trying not to make any sound at all. It's long, hard, and dirty, but it's probably the best thing we did all night). <br /><br />My only complaint is that there was a lot more resting than I had hoped/planned for. Part of this is almost required, seeing as there is some required waiting for room to open up for some of the activities, but we finished in around 3 hours this time. Next time, I want to aim for 2.5. <br /><br />Of course, every Hell Night will be different. Next week we're going to do it all in the opposite order, partially so we can get to the really awesome rock precisions before it gets too dark. <br /><br />However, I was VERY impressed by everyone. There's a lot of work to be done, but I think if people stick with it, as well as the rest of their training, we can really turn ourselves into something special. Especially once the dogsled gets built. (That's right. I said dogsled. Note: There will be no dogs involved in the pulling of this sled...)<br /><br /><img src="http://www.zaccohn.com/pics/hell/group1.jpg" alt="Hell Night Participants"><br />(Left to right: Artem, Zachary (me), Charlie, Zack, Mike, Eric, Andres)<br /><br />Great Job, guys. Lets keep it up.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Artem, Charlie and I travelled down to Philadelphia this past weekend for a jam at Drexel University. It was quite awesome. Pretty good turnout, had people from NYC/NJ, Rochester, Buffalo, Philly, and even Baltimore, MD.<br /><br />We got to Philly at about 2AM on Saturday morning, and promptly went to sleep. We woke up at 8:30 to meet the rest of the tracuers coming in and we started jamming! We began at 30th Street Station doing some precisions on Jersey Barriers until the K9 unit showed up... After that we met up with M1l3s from NYPK - he was running 10 miles for the Step Up to Fight Diabetes charity event. Then it was a full day of walking, from Drexel's campus, to Temple, UPenn, Central City/City Hall, Philadelphia Museum of Art (where the stair scene from Rocky was filmed), and more. Saturday night, people headed back to Drexel to go to sleep, except for Jessie, Pyro, Blaarg and I. We decided to try and train all night long. We may not have ended up training all night, but we were out in Philly all night, and it was really awesome. We did SO much walking and we were exhausted, but spending the entire night in a foreign city is definitely a cool experience.<br /><br />Sunday was spent doing a little bit more training at the Museum, where we had three or four groups of people come up to us and ask us what we were doing. We demonstrated, and taught, some pretty basic precisions, and then we got our pictures taken. After that, we were all very tired, and we started the 6 hour drive back home.<br /><br />Thanks to everyone for making this an awesome Jam!<br /><a href="http://www.zaccohn.com/port/pics/parkour/full/PhillyGroupMedium.jpg" title="Philadelphia Parkour Jam"><img src="http://www.zaccohn.com/port/pics/parkour/thumb/PhillyGroupSmall.jpg" alt="Philadelphia Parkour Jam"/></a><br /><br />In other news, I'm in the middle of reorganizing all of my pictures and videos. <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/zaccohn/" title="Zachary Cohn's Parkour Pictures and Videos">Here's</a> a new link to a (probably) temporary Picasa page with two albums (one for pictures, one for videos). Most are fairly new (a lot are from Philly infact, so if you want to see some of the pictures and videos from there, check it out!). Hopefully more will be added soon!]]></content:encoded>

But for now, these are clips mostly from Philly, but one from NYC and one from Rochester. I just put some recent clips together to show people more easily than giving them 15 download links.<br /><br /><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/hK9BLzwLW8o"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/hK9BLzwLW8o" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object><br /><br /><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=hK9BLzwLW8o" title="Rochester Philly NYC Parkour">Youtube link</a>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>RIT Training Video - Fall 2007</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sunday, we decided to make a training video. It became a 13 hour ordeal... but it is done! 4 hours of filming, (about 2 hours of eating,) and then a 7 hour marathon editing session... but I think it turned out really well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there were only four of us on Sunday, so the video doesn't give an accurate representation of the usual group, but there was still a good variety of skill levels present. Charlie and Artem are still relatively new, Joe had a decent amount of experience, but has never really trained with anyone else, and Zac (me) has been training for almost 2 years.<br /><br />In Mid-Atlantic news, Primal Fitness (the Parkour Gym in DC) has moved! Only about a mile, it's just the next subway station down from where it was before. They have moved to a bigger location, and now offer more classes. If you're ever down in the area, I HIGHLY recommend you check them out. Mark and Jessie (the owners) are really great guys, and their Parkour classes are great for beginners and advanced traceurs alike.<br /><br /><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/CuFbF7rFWLs"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/CuFbF7rFWLs" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object><br /><br /><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=CuFbF7rFWLs" tags="rochester parkour training">Youtube version of the RIT Parkour Training 2007 video.</a>]]></content:encoded>

Helping out people like you are why I started this blog in the first place. <br/><br/>The one good place I know if in Rochester is Manhattan Square Park, near the Strong (Children's?) Museum. It's a pretty cool spot. <br/><br/>You're also always welcome to train with us at RIT, just email me (zaccohn@gmail.com) or send me a message on AIM (superhappydud) and I can give you directions, times, places, etc.<br/><br/>I don't know of many more really good spots in Rochester, I haven't been to the city too many times myself. If you find any, definitely let me know and the RIT crowd will make a field trip!<br/><br/>Hit me up, I'd love to talk to you more! Until then... happy training. :)]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have way, way too much time on my hands this Thanksgiving break, so I'm going to post some goals with the intention of accomplishing at least some of them before I return to Rochester.<br /><br /><ul><br /><li> Hold a handstand - AND CONTROL IT - for a solid 6 seconds.<br /><li> Hold a bent-knees flag for 5 seconds.<br /><li> Land my back tucks on my feet, consistently.<br /><li> Learn how to do a 540 roundhouse, at least well enough to teach it to someone else in Rochester.<br /><li> Start learning wall flips.<br /></ul><br /><br />That should do for now. The first two I can do at home, the third I <i>can</i> do at home... at the second two I'm going to hit up Acro and Emiles (two gymnastics gyms) and try to get someone to help me.<br /><br />So that's my plan for this Thanksgiving break!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, I didn't complete all of my goals, but I did a decent job. I ended up going on a self-imposed week of rest first week of break, because my body was just self-destructing from overuse. After the week, I felt FANTASTIC though, and training resumed, and it resumed hard. Tuesday I trained with Doc Akh in Westminster, at McDaniels, and then we went to Acro (gymnastics gym) and I helped him teach his Parkour class. Wednesday was training at AACC with Disciple, Thursday I went down to Primal Fitness to play with Disciple and take their Advanced Parkour class. <br /><br />And then Friday. I got at text from hardcoretraceur at about 8PM, telling me he was coming down to DC (He lives near NYC) with Kasper (who was staying with him, and lives in the Bahamas). Long story short, I drove down to DC at 4AM to pick him up from the bus, we came back to my house and crashed for a few hours. After breakfast, we met up with nickm, Ben Horn, and Disciple to train at AACC, and then we went to Primal to build things, hang out, go through a few Crossfit workouts, a Parkour open gym, and then we slept there. The next morning, we trained at Primal for most of the day again. So anyawy, things I accomplished:<br /><br />GOALS/ACCOMPLISHMENTS:<br /><ul><br /><li>Hold a handstand - AND CONTROL IT - for a solid 6 seconds. - I didn't do as much handstand work as I would have liked, but I was able to hold a handstand for a good 4 or 5 seconds, although I had to use the wall to get up.<br /><li>Hold a bent-knees flag for 5 seconds. - Did not have time to work on this.<br /><li>Land my back tucks on my feet, consistently. - Figured out the main reason I'm screwing up. (Bringing knees and shoulders together, instead of knees to shoulders.) They're getting consistently better, so I'd say goal pretty much accomplished.<br /><li>Learn how to do a 540 roundhouse, at least well enough to teach it to someone else in Rochester. - My 540 is pretty good, though the landing needs more practice. I'd give it a Mission Accomplished.<br /><li>Start learning wall flips. - Did not have time to work on these. <br /></ul><br /><br />Others: <br /><ul><br /><li>I am a lot more comfortable with my Kong to Cat now, as well as my Kong to precision.<br /><li>Started training on some trees. There are some trees that are hotspots by themselves...<br /><li>I think I finished getting all the footage I need for Countdown (movie I'm working on with Ben Corwin). We should have it finished by Christmas.<br /></ul><br /><br /><br />In other news, I don't think I ever posted a link to the presentation I gave to Campus Safety. You can find the Power Point presentation <a href="http://www.zaccohn.com/parkour/ParkourPresentation.ppt" title="RIT Parkour Powerpoint">here</a>. This does not include what I said, which really is the important part, but it is mostly just a list of topics I covered. Feel free to edit and use this for your own purposes, just give credit where credit is due if asked.<br /><br />Also, RIT Parkour now has their own subforum on American Parkour. You can find it <a href="http://www.americanparkour.com/smf/index.php?board=158.0" title="RIT's Sub-Forum on American Parkour">here</a>. So if you go to RIT or are from Rochester, or just want more information about our training plans, swing on by!]]></content:encoded>

Every nuance of every movement must be accomplished, or it is meaningless.  Consider that for yourself, surely.<br/><br/>Good luck with all your training.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Okay, apparently my reply got automagically deleted.<br/><br/>Summary of what it said: "These goals weren't really "I want to perfect <i>whatever</i>" so much as they were more "I want to get better, and learn how I can better these techniques."<br/><br/>Example, backtucks. My backtucks did not improve much over the break, however I did identify two or three things that would make them much much better.<br/><br/>Example, 540. Obviously, I did not learn to perfect my 540 in a week. I'm no where even close. However, I learned a lot about the kick, enough so I can work on it on my own. <br/><br/>The biggest problem I have with learning new skills is that I don't know of anyone here in Rochester that has both A) These same interests, AND B) knows more than I do and can teach me. So I need to harvest as much information as I can from people who DO know more than I while I can, and then apply it on my own. I suppose that was really the mission.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Winter/Christmas Break is upon us, and with this break comes another set of goals. (Some ALREADY accomplished by the time I made this post!)<br /><br /><ul><br /><li>Wallflips. (Already learned. I can do them in the gym, I want to practice there a little bit more before I try them outside, but they're pretty easy.)<br /><li>Layout from height. (Already learned! I would like to practice these a bit more, but I am really, really confident in them, so I could probably do them outside right now.)<br /><li>Sideflips. (Already learned! Kind of. They need a lot more practice in the gym. The landing is.. sparradic at best, and I have too much rotation in the wrong directions.)<br /><li>Handstands. Getting better, but I still can't hold it solidly for any decent length of time.<br /><li>540 kick. Again, getting better. I can land them more reliably and correctly now, but still want more work.<br /><li>Frontflips. This is a maybe. If I'm doing really well with all my other goals, I'll start learning and practicing the basics of a frontflip.<br /></ul><br /><br />In other news, about half of NYPK is coming down on January 2nd and 3rd to visit. The plan is to have some people drive and meet at my house, and others take a bus to DC, then we're going to spend the day at Primal and various spots around DC, perhaps Silver Spring? Then that night, we're going to come back to my house and crash, and then go to AACC to train the next day, and perhaps Emilias or Xtreme Acro (gymnastics gyms) to train for a bit, then they leave. It should be pretty awesome, expecting upwards of 10 people, plus all the guys I train with here in Severna Park. <br /><br />I can't wait! This is going to be a good break.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>New York Parkour Goes Primal</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On Wednesday, January 2nd, I hosted a group of traceurs from New York and New Jersey who bussed and drove down to visit Primal Fitness and the DC scene. Chris "Phreaknite" Salvato (spelling) is moving to Colorado soon, and wanted to visit Primal before he left. So over the course of a few weeks, we planned out and organized the trip. In the end, nine traceurs came down and joined Travis Noble, who was down visiting Primal from Michigan, and RandomPKGuy (RPG) and I for a really great jam.<br /><br />It started at 10:30 when I picked up Jesse “Hardcoretraceur” from the bus station in Baltimore. We came back to my house, cleaned up a bit, and then I (almost) taught him to juggle while waiting for everyone else to arrive. We heard Vert and Arfel yelling as they got out of the car, and so we met them at the door, along with Pheaknite, Pyro, and Ish. My roommates from school, Artem and Charlie "ChadManX", arrived shortly later.  We hung out in the basement until it was time to go to Xtreme Acro and Cheer, a nearby gymnastics gym. We called M1L3S, who was still en-route, and had him meet us there. We piled into cars and drove an hour to Acro to meet up with Travis and RPG.<br /><br />Much fun was had at Acro! Wallflips, backtucks, layouts, frontflips, diverolls, trampolines, butterfly kicks, and more. We ended up staying about 30 minutes past when we were supposed to, and then packed in the car and came back to my house. The twelve of us promptly ordered 7 pizzas, and finished them off in about as many minutes. The rest of the night was pretty low key, the highlight being Jesse  giving himself quite the shiner after running into a pole in my woods while playing Predator versus Prey (Aliens!).<br /><br />The next morning Charlie and I got up at 6:45 and started making pancakes. Artem soon joined us in our endeavor, and Happydud's Emporium of Pancakes was moving along at full steam ahead! 64 pancakes, 1 box of pancake mix, 7 eggs, 5 cups of milk, a dash of olive oil, and one failed batch of pancakes later, everyone was up and eating pancakes, cereal, fruit, yogurt, and anything else we could find in the house. We managed, amazingly, to get out the door by 9:00AM (I did NOT think this was possible) and we headed to Primal Fitness, the main attraction.<br /><br />After some creative convoying, we got to Primal as Jesse “Gearsighted” Woody, Steve Low, Leonn, and Britney were setting up a projector. We projected a big PRIMAL FITNESS onto the far wall, traced it, and then painted it in red. <img src="http://www.zaccohn.com/pics/nypkprimal/s_primalpaint.jpg" title="Newly painted Primal Fitness sign" /> Other things got painted throughout the day as well, like the spiderweb, and a recreation of a Banksy.   <img src="http://www.zaccohn.com/pics/nypkprimal/s_charliebanksy.jpg" title="Charlie next the new Banksy painting" />As far as the Parkour went, it was pretty awesome, as always. Leonn and Travis ran a really good warmup, which actually gave me a lot of ideas of what I want to incorporate into my standard warmup. Skipper stopped by, and the training continued throughout the entire day. The room was rearranged every few minutes to create new obstacle combinations and to drill different techniques. Later in the afternoon, Mark decided to run us through a workout.<br /><br />The warmup: 3 rounds: 25x20lbs sumo-deadlift high-pulls, 1 lap of QM, 1 lap “uncomfortably high stepping” (stepping through a line of 3 to 4 foot boxes), 10 decline pushups.<br /><br />I'm still convinced that Crossfit style “warmups” are equivilent to the workouts that some people usually get.<br /><br />After the warmup, we got to the workout. Mark yells “Okay, who's ready for 3 minutes of conditioning?” I respond sarcastically “Only 3 minutes? This should be easy!” We went back to the line of eight 3 to 4 foot plyometric boxes and lined up.<br /><br />The workout: 3 minutes, as many rounds through as you can. Two footed jump from the ground to the top of the first box. Jump from box to the ground. Jump from the ground to the next box. Rinse, wipe hands on pants, repeat. It was pretty hellish. By the end of the third minute, my legs felt like lead.<br /><br />Afterwards, we ran through some jumping and landing drills designed to facilitate the ease of continued running after a landing, without stumbling, slowing down, putting your hands down, etc. We were supposed to start at one speed and accelerate throughout the course. We started by running and jumping off of different sized plyo-boxes, and then we eventually built up to running, jumping onto one box, jumping to a higher box, and then leaping to the ground and resume running without ever slowing down. We then modified to it getting over the second box the fastest way for you. For some people, this was a kong, for others, it was stepping on it and jumping, still others speed vaulted it or just leaped straight over it. It was a fascinating thing to watch: to see four different people could pass over the box in four completely different ways, and each path was the most efficient for them. It was a great example of how there is never one correct way to do something, and how what works for one person may not work for another.<br /><br />In the end, everyone eventually went their separate ways and headed back home. Everyone had a fantastic time, and the jam just reaffirmed something I see traceurs from different places training together. Despite being from DC, Brooklyn, Michigan, or anywhere in between, despite some people having never met before, or others only having met once or twice, traceurs can come together and instantly become best of friends. We may come from different communities geographically, but we're all one big community when it comes to Parkour.<br /><img src="http://www.zaccohn.com/pics/nypkprimal/s_primal.jpg" title="This is Primal Fitness." /><br /><img src="http://www.zaccohn.com/pics/nypkprimal/s_group.jpg" title="New York Parkour" />]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last Saturday (January 5th) I closed a deal with a local Rochester gymnastics gym, <a href="http://www.zenith-gym.com/" title="Zenith Gymnastics">Zenieth</a>. Basically, we pay them a bit of money on a weekly basis, and they let us go to their gym for an hour and a half on Saturday afternoons. Today was the first time we went, and we had <b>a blast</b>.<br /><br />People from Gymnastics Club and Parkour came, as well as other people we've come across who are interested in gymnastics and/or tricking. I didn't end up getting a final count, but I would estimate about twenty people. The best part is there are even more people who want to show up (regularly, too!) who just already had plans for this weekend and couldn't make it. Everyone had a great time, and it seemed like Amy and Neil - the owners of the gym - enjoyed having us there. The two coaches (who are both Olympic level coaches... yeah. wow.) both seemed like they had a great time teaching and watching us.<br /><br />We started off in a big circle and ran through some warmups and stretches. After that, everyone just scattered. People worked on backtucks (and other things) on the trampoline, tumbling on the floor, cartwheels, roundoffs, 540 and butterfly kicks, layouts, and then we even set up some padding on the wall and worked on wallflips. When I started to put it against the wall, the male coach came over and said "Flips off the wall?" and I just smiled. DJ and Andrew came over to join me, and the three of us were doing one, two, and Andrew even attempted (and landed!) a three step wallflip. We even had some of the nine year olds that were there (not with us) there, and they nailed some pretty awesome flips. Artem came over and tried (which was pretty funny. His still needs some work..), and I'm a lot more comfortable with them now. I'm going to move to a less padded wall in the wrestling room here at school and drill them there for a bit, but I think I'm close to the point where I can try them outside. Just a few more sessions of drilling to make sure.<br /><br />We gave a brief Parkour demonstration to the owners of the gym. I think they were a little bit wary, but I gave them a pretty good description of what was going on, and what Parkour was all about, and I think with a bit of time we can win them over and get them to really understand what Parkour is all about.<br /><br />There were a few pictures taken, and I'll edit this post and put them up when I get ahold of them, but I mostly just didn't have time to take any. Too busy doing everything else! Everyone had a great time, and we will definitely be back in force next Saturday.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I started programming in tenth grade. I started with a year-long Visual Basic class, then a year long AP Java class. During my senior year of high school, I worked for the National Security Agency (the FBI is who you hear breathing on the other end of the line, and the CIA is the one that topples foreign governments hostile to the USA. We're the good guys). 

One day my manager came up to me and described a fairly complex project he wanted done in Perl. 

“But I don't know Perl.”

“That's okay. Here's six books. (He dropped them on my desk) The rest of the O'Reilly books are on the intranet. Take as long as you need.”

3 months later, I had completed the project. 

I went to Rochester Institute of Technology to study Computer Science, because I really enjoyed programming. I loved problem solving, I loved being able to type some characters, then see something happen. And if I changed a few characters? I could make something completely different happen. It's like being an architect, but you don't have to wait years for someone else to build your skyscraper. But after a year or so, I realized something. 

I wasn't a particularly stellar developer. 

I certainly wasn't bad - I had a good work ethic, a good attitude, and I really enjoyed programming. I got assignments done in class and I finished a few side projects. But I was solidly in the middle of the pack. And that's when I realized I had a decision to make. 

Did I want to be a mediocre developer, or did I want to be an awesome something else?

I decided I wanted to be an awesome something else. 

I ended up learning about business, marketing, organization, and leadership by actually DOING it all through the [link]awesome parkour community[link] I developed in Rochester. At some point I realized I have a very unique skillset – I understand technology and I can code, but I also understand business, marketing, and how to get shit done.  

I walk that line between “tech guy” and “business guy.” And that is something I am awesome at.]]></content:encoded>

Artem, Charlie and I are leaving in about an hour to go down to New York City for the rest of the week. <a href="http://www.parkourgenerations.com/" title="Parkour Generations">Parkour Generations</a> is coming down, and they're holding an informal workshop/training session in Central Park on Thursday at 11AM.<br /><br />It's going to be cold, wet, and awesome. Detailed update when we get back.<br /><br />In other news, I have made meeting appointments with several more people in regards to the RIT Parkour club becoming official. Those will be occuring in the next two weeks - I'll update and let everyone know how those went after htey occur. Here's to hoping, though.<br /><br />But now, it's time to pack (Read: cram a bunch of crap into a bag).]]></content:encoded>

If you know any practicing teen traceurs, that would be great too!<br/>It's weird but parkour gets very little serious ink seems to me, and I'd like to change that.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On February 14th, Dan Edwardes, Stephane Vigroux, Chris Keighley, and Julie Angel came down to Central Park for a day-long workshop. Artem, Charlie and I showed up at Heckscher Park (an area in Central Park) around 10AM, and there were already a good 20 or 30 people there. We warmed up, did some small balance and precision drills for a while, until around 11. A group of four people walked up to us, and one spoke in a British accent "So.. are you guys Traceurs?"<br /><br />After a (long) series of introductions, we hung around Heckscher for a bit longer, waiting for more people to show up, and then the day began.<br /><br />We began with some light joint work: neck, shoulder, elbow, knee and ankle stretching. We then went for a short jog forwards, backwards, and to both sides. We slowed to a stop then Dan dropped to his hands and feet, and began to QM around the area we had just jogged. At about the halfway point, we continued QMing backwards.<br /><br />Then we ran into our first problem. The Park Police decided that what we were doing 'could endanger the kids (of which there weren't any around...)' and 'adults weren't allowed to play in the park.' So we asked them nicely where we could train, and they directed us towards a baseball field. So we moved there.<br /><br />After doing some (read: a lot) of squat work, we went back to some more QM. This time, we were doing a couple different levels of sideways QM. We started by just moving left and right in the QM position. We later incorporated leg lifts, both holding it still and moving the leg up and down, into the workout. About this time we ran into problem number 2. The Park Police came by and decided that we were "risking the children" again (keep in mind, this was a fenced in field, and there were no kids in sight, let alone on this side of the fence.)<br /><br />So we moved a ways away to a muddy hill, where we did some push up work. We started with a 10-second pushup. They made us do a ton of variations on pushups: going down, and then moving our upper bodies in circles, putting our weight on our left arm, went down, shifted to the right, and pressing up, going into the down position, then rolling back onto our elbows, back to the hands, and up, what I call "dive bomber pushups" where you start in a ^ shape, and go down, leading with your head, and then arch you back up, and retrace going back.<br /><br />Then we put them all together. Between the crazy types of pushups and the freezing mud, it was pretty hard. Almost everyone had to take a rest break, and a lot of people dropped out entirely before the end. The Parkour Generations guys though not only forged on, but were talking, teaching, and encouraging us the entire time. It was truly inspirational what they were capable of. While we were weeping and trying to keep up, they told us that this is their standard warmup that everyone, men, women, young and old, go through at their Academy.<br /><br />Please check your ego at the door.<br /><br />Stephane took over at this point - leading us across the street to do some precision/confidence building work. There was probably a 9 foot gap between two curbs (a pedestrian walkway). He had us leap on one foot to the center of the walkway, and then precision to the other curb, all in one motion. It was a very interesting drill, designed not to work on maximum distance, but on the landing and nailing it every time.<br /><br />After a while, Stephane led us on a "Follow the Leader" style adventure through the giant rocks in Central Park. A lot of precision work, and also a lot of bouldering and rock climbing, which was enjoyable. Stephane was a very interesting person to follow, his movements were so natural it was... unnatural.<br /><br />After the Follow the Leader session was over, we pretty much spread out and worked on random drills on our own, or inspired by the Parkour Generations guys. Around 1230, we decided to split into three groups, one lead by each representative from PKG.<br /><br />My group followed Stephane through the woods of Central Park. A lot of forest-parkour here: climbing through, around, over, and under trees, scaling pretty tall rock walls, and more. There was one rock wall, perhaps 20 feet tall, that we were climbing.<br /><br />Stephane decided to do it without hands.<br /><br />We eventually regrouped back near Heckscher, and then broke and headed to Whole Foods for lunch. Afterwards, we resumed training on the rocks, and then we migrated to different parts of Central Park for the rest of the day. We got kicked out of a few more places, which is unfortunate, but there were about 60 of us at that point, so it makes sense.<br /><br />The British have a very interesting take on Parkour. The V-day workshop focused very intensely on precisions and climbing, and far less than a lot of people would have expected on vaults. (Although to be fair, I'm sure they are equally ridiculously good at those, the environment just did not clalf or it.) I did not learn much to improve my technique, I don't really think that was the goal, and if that's all you got out of it then I think you wasted a lot of time.<br /><br />What I learned from Parkour Generations was an incredible amount about <i>potential.</i> I already knew the importance of conditioning, but what they do every day blows me out of the water. What they were physically capable of astounded and inspired me. I'm already re-evaluating my training, and planning out how I'm going to change both how I train, and how I train others.<br /><br />Parkour Generations is planning on coming back to America soon, so if at all possible, attend one of their workshops. It is 150% worth it.<br /><br />Unforunately, I was a little bit busy to get many pictures, but I did snag a picture of each of our visitors. I'll be posting those a bit later tonight.<br /><br />[edit - HOW COULD I HAVE FORGOTTEN? At the end of they day, Parkou Generations led us through a "warmdown." I put that in quotes because the only similarity it had to a warm down was that by the end, I was very warm, and wanted to sit down for a very long time. They ran us through an ab workout where the rest position was balancing on your butt with your legs folded against you chest. The second rest position was laying on the ground, shoulders and feet off the ground. Everything when we weren't resting was... a lot worse.<br /><br />After the "warmdown," we went to find a place where we could all talk. We ended up at the upstairs room of Wendy's. We had a loose Q&amp;A session that lasted almost two hours. Everyone asked questions and listened as the PKG guys spoke on topics ranging from their favorite food (cashews) to what Parkour meant to them. Then they asked us for advice - what do we think would help the growing American community the most? Advice ranged from more tutorial videos to articles giving ideas and specifics about warmups and and warmdowns.<br /><br />I don't know how I forgot about that when I was typing this originally! It was probably the best part.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Wow, a lot has happened since I last updated. Sorry for the long break. I'm planning on updating much more frequently, hopefully once a day - even if it's just with a picture or a video.<br /><br />Speaking of videos, last week I went back home to Severna Park, MD with my roommate Charlie, and filmed a video for Brian "Doc Akh" Belida's "Mid-Atlantic Monthly Member Movie" project. Found below!<br /><br /><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/jATeMj5JWY8"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/jATeMj5JWY8" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object><br /><br /><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=jATeMj5JWY8" tags="Zac Happydud Cohn PK Vision">Link to youtube version of Zac "Happydud" Cohn's <b>PK Vision</b></a><br /><br />A bit of history on the name: The phrase "PK Vision" is what some people call your shift in how you observe your environment once you've been training for a while. You start to see possibilities everywhere, whereas before you just saw a table, or a wall.<br /><br />Study time now, but I'll be updating tomorrow probably about my Spring Break, and all the fun that was had.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Spring Break? More like Spring Active.</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My titles really are lame sometimes...<br /><br />So I am recently returned to Rochester from RIT's Spring Break. I went back home to Maryland with my roommate Charlie. Our break was incredibly fun and exciting, and anything but relaxing.<br /><br />We got back on Wednesday and were treated to some of my sister's fine cooking, and Thursday we woke up nice and early and headed to Primal Fitness, the Parkour gym in Washington DC, for the day!<br /><br />Primal was, as always, awesome. We arrived around 11am and spent a few hour hanging out with Mark. We talked about Parkour and future plans, I accidentally interrupted a video capture that had been taking hours to complete, and we helped out around the gym a little bit. Lunch time rolled around and we grabbed some Chinese food, ate Mark's, and played with his dogs (SO ADORABLE). By the time we got back to the gym, it was time for the evening workouts and Parkour classes. During the Crossfit Workout, we met up with Steven Low and fooled around a bit, and eventually ended up doing weighted pull-ups. We started light (bodyweight + 40lbs), and kept increasing to our max. I died at about 80lbs, Steve managed to knock out an incredible 115lbs - which is practically as much as he weighs!<br /><br />The Crossfitter's started to clear out, and then it was time for the Parkour class. While I was helping some beginners with their kongs, Charlie and the rest of the class was working on more advanced Kong techniques, primarily double kong's and kong to cats. I popped by and gave it a few tries. It appears I have an issue misjudging the distance I travel when doing a kong, because I had some fairly epic bails while trying to cat. I think I'm going to work on my kong to precisions more to fix this.<br /><br />That was Thursday, the first day of my break! Stay tuned tomorrow for an outline of Friday. Sadly, I didn't take many (if any) pictures over the break. I was a bit too busy training to carry around a camera. Here's a picture halfway through a kong to cat though, which is what we were working on at Primal:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.kiell.com/misc/ecko_kong_cat_imax_fp.jpg" title="kong to cat"><br /><br /><br />Also, don't forget to check out my new video, PK Vision! See yesterday's post, or use this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPYSlSYP_LY" title="Zac Happydud Cohn's PK Vision video">link</a>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I don't have a lot of time to update today, classes and such, but I just want to point everyone towards what I think is a very important post by Eliot, an Australian tracuer. The link is <a href="http://traceurcamel.wordpress.com/2008/03/13/parkour-training-to-be-helpful/" title="Parkour blog">here</a>, and the text of the article is copied below:<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>Parkour: To be helpful, to be capable, to be useful.<br /><br />We as traceurs train ourselves to be useful, we train ourselves for reach and escape situations so that we can help others when they are in need. Whether it be helping people out of a burning building, or escaping from a pack of guys that would rather see you dead. But should our training go further? Should we limit ourselves to using physical applications of our training?<br />Most traceurs would already acknowledge that through parkour one develops a new mind set that can, perhaps, make us more inclined to help people in trouble, or to be confident. But I’m talking about taking it a step further, actually going out of our way, in to the community to help people, not just waiting for someone in trouble to present themselves.<br /><br />Here in Australia we have people from many walks of life, many from wealthy backgrounds, many from poor backgrounds, we have European, Asian, African, American, Latin, Indigenous etc. etc. With such a wide array of backgrounds we are bound to have a wide array of problems, and we do. We face racial problems, moral problems, health issues, physical disabilities, financial difficulties, and many others, for many of our citizens. These people all need help, and guidance. We, as traceurs have the ability to provide this help.<br /><br />We train hard to become strong, to become fast, fit and fluid, but there are not many that actually train to help those who are disadvantaged. Not many that go out of their way to improve others lives. This should be a key part in our training, this should be as big a part as training physically. This philosophy of helping others and being a valuable member of the community is what sets us apart from other street sports and ‘fads’.<br />Many youths today face terrible problems such as homelessness, depression, and domestic violence, however there are organisations, such as Youth off the Streets who try and help these people. Our discipline has the ability to appeal to the youth of today and give them a step up, and I believe that we have the moral obligation to further our training to help these people, help them have a new start, help them to become strong individuals mentally, and get back on their feet.<br /><br />To follow the true parkour ethos, groups should be involved in community activities such as donating blood, raising money for charity, helping troubled youths etc.<br /><br />I encourage all traceurs to participate in blood donation, events like the Red Shield Door Knock appeal, the 40 hour famine.<br />Talk to your local youth center and organise a class for disadvantaged people. Find out what programs are being run in your area and offer assistance, you can incorporate your physical training with these philosophies.<br />Send out information to your local members of government and let them know we’re here, and ready and willing to provide help. Talk to your parents, they know more than you could imagine, and they have connections :)<br />Get involved in as many things as you can and get the positive image for Parkour Australia (and world) wide out there!<br /><br />We’re not just another street fad, we are not just a variation of skating, we’re here to help, and we’re here to benefit our community.<br /><br />Be Pro-Active! <br /><br /> <br /><br />“To be Strong, to be useful” - Georges Hebert.<br /><br />Do you think he merely meant physically?</i><br /><br /><br />I think this is something every Traceur should seriously think about. Go out, organize some community service project. Repair and rebuild something at the park where you train, repaint fences, pick up trash, something. It's more important than just community service - it shows the world that Parkour isn't just about jumping off of stuff and being reckless, it shows that we're serious about what we're doing. That we actually do care.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For the longest time, I've always wanted to wander. Every few months I'd come up with an idea. Last year I spent about a week trying to figure out how long it would take to walk across the country, from the Atlantic to the Pacific (ending in San Fransisco, because it's the best city that side of New York City).<br /><br />For the few past month or so, I've been planning a Cross-country Parkour tour for this summer. Within the past month, it's really taken off. I'm going to be crashing on traceurs' couches, chairs, beds, and floors. I'm going to be hitting up as many of the national jams as possible, and visiting as many local communities as I can. I'm also planning on buying a camcorder (read: already bought it, waiting for it to be shipped!) and making a documentary about the whole trip. Kind of a "This is how America trains!" sort of thing.<br /><br />These are the cities I'm planning on going to, most likely in this order:<br /><br /><br />DC<br />Pittsburgh<br />Philly<br />NYC<br />Cleveland<br />Detroit<br />Ann Arbor/UofM<br />Chicago<br />Minneapolis<br />Madison<br />Seattle<br />San Fransisco<br />LA<br />Phoenix<br />Denver<br />Oklahoma City<br />San Antonio<br />Austin<br />Miami<br />West Palm Beach<br />Jacksonville<br />Athens, GA<br />Charlotte<br />Chapel Hill<br />DC<br /><br />I'm currently aiming for it taking about 7-8 weeks. I'll be starting in DC with (B)East Coast at the end of May, but then I'm hanging around the area until the Philly jam on June 6-7th. From there I'm headed back to NJ/NYC with Jesse/Hardcoretracuer, and I'm using his house as a base of operations until PKNY. So lucky NYC, I'll be around for two and a half, three weeks!<br /><br />After that will be the Chicago jam, and then a general wandering across northern America until I hit Seattle, then down the West Coast, across the South, and then back up the Eastern Coast until I get back to DC. Sadly, I'll be missing most of the non-eastern coast jams (Madison, Texas, Colorado). I'll still be going to all these places, I just can't make the dates work. Oh well!<br /><br />This trip should be pretty awesome. There will be pretty regular updates as to my progress, and then hopefully sometime in late August I'll have the final cut of the documentary done and released.<br /><br />If you think you can make it to one these places, let me know! I look forward to meeting as many traceurs as possible!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Just a quick update on some plans:<br /><br />We've started regular, outdoor Parkour training again. Sundays at 1PM outside of Margaret's house.<br /><br />This weekend is the RIT Juggle-in. It's three days of juggling, fun, and juggling! I also heard along the grape vine that a juggler from Edinburgh named Meghan Pike is coming. Google confirms that she was ALSO in Jump Britain... so maybe we'll be hanging out with a British traceuse! Should be cool.<br /><br />We're still looking a faculty adviser for the club. If anyone has any ideas, we're open to them...<br /><br />I think that's all for now. Bigger update coming soon.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Training Barefoot</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm sure we've all heard about people who train barefoot. A lot of us have looked at them like they're crazy. Shoes give added support, cushioning, and protection to the foot, right?<br /><br />Well, is it right? First lets look at some anecdotal evidence:<br /><br />Shoes are a fairly recent invention, being only several thousands of years old. The Hominini tribe, the earliest ancestors of Homo-sapiens genus, divulged from their Pan genus brethren 6.3 million years ago. The human foot, and all the body's supporting mechanisms for the foot, evolved over millions of years to be fairly good at what it does. We could probably trace the evolution of the human foot even farther back, but lets go from there. Human feet were designed to be walked on.  Shoes stop you from walking on them.<br /><br />You are probably wearing shoes right now. Take them off, and put one on your desk. Look at it. Do you see how the toe is curved upward? This is done so it is even possible to walk in shoes.<br /><br />When you walk barefoot, you strike with the middle of the heel, rolling forward onto the balls of the feet, and then there is a powerful push-off from the balls of the feet. When running, they were designed to strike in the midfoot, not the heel. Shoes alter your gait - when you walk in shoes, the back of your heel strikes first, and your foot rolls forward, and then you push off your toes which creates a rocking motion. When you run with shoes, it feels "natural" to run heel-to-toe, which causes a jarring shock to your ankles and knees. High heels exacerbate problems caused by an unnatural position of the foot. They cause different and unnatural stresses on the bones of the foot, the ankle, the knee, up to the pelvis and even through the shoulders.  It raises the heel, which is the foot's natural supporter of weight, by an inch, two inches, sometimes even four or five inches! The entire weight of the body is transferred to the ball of the foot, while the pelvis and the shoulders tilt to compensate for the difference in weight distribution.<br /><br />In terms of health, unshod feet have been proven healthier than their shoe-trapped relatives. Zulu, an African tribe, have healthier feet than their shoe-wearing Europeans counterparts, EXCEPT for the Zulus that work in coal mines, where they are "forced to wear ill-fitting footwear and stand on their feet for long hours." (http://web.wits.ac.za/NewsRoom/NewsItems/feet.htm) Foot fungus and other bacteria thrive in dark, damp places... such as inside of a shoe.<br /><br />Society is too focused on protection. Just like an over-obsessive use of anti-bacterial soap robs your body of the chance to be exposed to those bacteria and develop an immunity to them, exposing your body to minor threats strengthens it. Walking barefoot toughens the foot, while wearing shoes can destroy it. Even as an infant, wearing shoes too early or socks that are too tight can permanently inhibit  proper bone growth (http://www.unshod.org/pfbc/toysawfl.htm).<br /><br />How does all this relate to Parkour?<br /><br />I've trained barefoot several times in the past month, and each time is better than the last. Not only do you get back down to that primal feeling of your feet in the dirt and the grass, but it forces you to progress slowly. Slow progression is something I understood in Parkour, but I'm coming to realize its importance in everything. I'm recovering from a nasty case of tendonitis developed by rock climbing and bouldering WAY too much in the Winter. I didn't limit myself and let my body adapt, and now I'm facing the consequences.<br /><br />This happens all too often in Parkour, and training barefoot is a magnificent way to force this concept of slow progression. With shoes, I can do a 9.5 foot precision with little trouble. Without shoes, I was hesitant to attempt a 4 foot precision. I was second guessing myself when doing an extremely small cat. I lacked the confidence to land out of a certain kong. Without the "protection" shoes offered me, I was more halving the distances of most of my techniques. And I was elated. Not only was I learning more about an area of my body I had been neglecting (my feet), but by mastering and rebuilding my confidence when barefoot, those gains still exist when I am wearing shoes. Going barefoot means perfecting my form, or else there will be pain. Shoes mask imperfections in technique, but do not fully protect you from their consequences.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[They also really don't offer that much 'protection' in my eyes, I think  the biggest thing that they do is simply cut out a lot of the feedback that naturally comes from you're feet, making it seem as if they are padding out the forces when really you are just not feeling them because you're feet have no idea what is going on (they are naturally one of the most sensitive areas of the body). I mean really, how much ihmpact can a small bit of foam and rubber really protect you from?<br/><br/>I've started to go barefoot whenever I am teaching, it has me focus on the technique more and also adds a bit of a challenge that I wouldn't normally get just going over the fundamentals again with a class. I'm enjoying it a lot, why I'm also looking forward to K-Swiss's new Ariake Light's and the forthcoming Dietake :)]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Awesome article. I&#39;m a mostly full time barefooter, have been for half a year, off and on for a year or 2. My strength, speed, balance, connection to my environment and health is SO much better now. When I run, I am no longer winded and tired. I have more grip. My feet and legs are stronger. My joints aren&#39;t being pounded anymore. Going barefoot forces you to be more aware and more careful, you won&#39;t do things that you&#39;d do normally with shoes on, but from that comes better health, lasting joints, and a longer life hah<br /><br />If anyones thinking about starting barefoot training, start SLOW and SMALL, and progress according to how your body feels. Think of it as an arm thats been in a cast for a year, when you get it off, you don&#39;t start punching the bag and brachiating like crazy, you slowly reintroduce it to the things you used to do; first the basics, like walking, turning, jumping over things, balancing, then you progress to more technical as your strength and technique grow, you start to run, drop and vault, and soon you add more mileage, then you start to run faster and faster. <br /><br />I give my word when I say that barefooting has opened MANY new doors for me, and has made my overall wellness better.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>Summer Trip Details *Updated with bloglink*</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So it's been a little while since the last update. Whoops. I just wanted to fill everyone in a little on some more details about this summer:<br /><br />I have a couple of goals for my trip.<br />First, obviously I want to meet traceurs and traceuses from all over the country. I want to share training techniques and stories with people who are more, and less, experienced than I. I've trained with a lot of different people, and I think that I can share quite a bit of knowledge with the people I visit. That being said, I hope to learn just as much from all of the traceurs and traceuses that I meet on my trip.<br /><br />Second, one of my larger goals. I am going to record this entire trip on video. I am going to edit it all together into a documentary, sort of a "This is how America Trains" kind of thing. I'll be taking a lot of footage, and I'll be releasing smaller "jam coverage" media peices throughout my trip through <a href="http://www.americanparkour.com/">American Parkour</a>, but look for a longer documentary at the end of August or beginning of September.<br /><br />The current itinerary of major jams follows. Note, I may be arriving the night before, the morning of, or sometime during the day of these dates, depending on bus schedules:<br /><br />*Saturday, June 7th - Philly Jam II<br />*Friday, June 13th through Sunday June 15th - PKFR International Pittsburgh Jam<br />*Friday, June 20th through Sunday June 22nd - PKNY (New Jersey and NYC)<br />Monday, June 23rd through Tuesday, June 24th - Columbus, Ohio<br />Wednesday, June 25th through Friday, June 27th - Ann Arbor, Michigan<br />*Saturday, June 28th through Sunday, June 29th - Chicago Jam<br />Monday, June 30th through Wednesday, July 2nd - Madison, Wisconsin<br />Thursday, July 3rd through Friday, July 4th - Minneapolis, Minnesota<br />Saturday, July 5th through Wednesday, July 9th - Seattle, Washington<br />Thursday, July 10th through Tuesday, July 15th - San Fransisco, California<br />Wednesday, July 16th through Thursday, July 17th - Phoenix, Arizona<br />Friday, July 18th through Tuesday, July 22nd - Denver, Colorado<br />*Wednesday, July 23rd through Tuesday, July 29th - San Antonio, Texas<br />Tuesday, July 29th through Wednesday, July 30th - Tampa, Florida<br />Thursday, July 31st through Friday, August 1st - Miami, Florida<br />Saturday, August 2nd - Athens, Georgia<br />Sunday, August 3rd through Tuesday, August 5th - Charlotte, North Carolina<br />Wednesday, August 6th through Friday, August 8th - Chapel Hill, North Carolina<br />Saturday, August 9th - back home to Severna Park, Maryland!<br /><br />*'s denote "National Jams"<br /><br />I hope to meet as many people along this trip as possible. I plan on putting together an email list to keep people informed of how and what I'm doing (if you want to be on it, comment on this post!), and I'll be making regular posts on American Parkour detailing more of the Parkour oriented aspects of my trip. You can find a lot of the pictures, videos, and bloggings <a href="http://www.americanparkour.com/content/blogcategory/110/352/" title="Zac's Summer Parkour Adventure">here</a>, or you can go to <a href="http://www.americanparkour.com/" title="American Parkour">American Parkour</a>, go to the top-menu item "Where's Zac" and see the listing there.<br /><br />If you'd like to contact me about my trip, or you're interested in meeting me somewhere along the way, send me an email at zaccohn@gmail.com and let me know! I'm sure we can work something out.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.americanparkour.com/teamapk/Happydud/Pictures/PrimalZac.JPG" tags="Primal Fitness Parkour">]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So, I've been neglecting this blog a little bit. I feel bad, but I've been quite busy. I left June 6th for my cross country trip, and since then I've been in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Bloomfield, New Jersey, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, New York, New York, Columbus, Ohio, Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Chicago, Illinois. Tomorrow I leave for Madison, Wisconsin.<br /><br />Everyone I've stayed with so far has been awesome, and the people I've met have been awesomer. I haven't, however, had a lot of time. I have a to-do list that's about 37 entries long, and sadly updating my blog is not at the top... For each of the major jams I've been to, I've written a summary and edited together a 3-5 minute video. I've been working on several other really great projects too, and I'll be announcing or releasing those fairly shortly.<br /><br />I have to go to bed now, I'm totally worn out from Chicago. But long story short: I apologize for not updating more, and I promise I'll be updating more often. Over the next few days I'll be posting links to the videos of the major jams here, so check back often!<br /><br />If you want to follow my trip more closely, you can check out <a href="http://www.americanparkour.com/content/blogcategory/110/352/" title="Where's Zac?">Where's Zac? on www.AmericanParkour.com</a>. I'm posting my write ups and videos there for the whole Parkour community to see.<br /><br />For now, the Philly video:<br /><br /><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://youtube.com/v/tDKzB-TdSCE"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://youtube.com/v/tDKzB-TdSCE" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey, Zac, it's Rich, I met you at the big Parkour Jam on Saturday. I want to do a story on Parkour and about the commitment you guys have for it and I was wondering if I could talk to you more about it. I know you're not from Chicago (And that's mainly the focus I want for the story) but I would definitely like to talk to you further on the matter. If you could get back to me sometime soon, that would be great. I'm leaving my contact info below. Thanks a lot, man, and I hope to hear from you soon.<br/><br/>Rich Knight<br/>Medill News Wire<br/>973-896-5262<br/>riknight36@aol.com]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm going to start posting a story from most of the places I visit. I'm going to start out with Madison, Wisconsin:<br /><br />Alissa (Muse_of_Fire) and I were in the car, driving to a daycamp for pre-teen boys and girls in Madison. This was the first day we were working with Girls, Inc (the group that runs this camp), and we had absolutely no idea what to expect. We didn't know whether we'd be working with boys, girls, or both. We didn't know what kind of facilities we had to work with, or how many people we'd have to work with.<br /><br />The night before, Alissa, Chad (her training partner), and I had dinner and planned out what we were going to do the next day. It took about two hours, and due to The Game (if you say certain words, you have to do 10 pushups), there were pretty constant distractions - but we finally worked out a rough lesson plan. We would start with a Julie Angel video, give a brief talk about Parkour, then, boys or girls, we were going to focus heavily on games.<br /><br />We pull up to the driveway and get out of the car. We examine the Kennedy Heights Community Center, it's pretty much just a big temp building. There's a wooden fence outside for balancing, and a playground around the back. The director of the camp came out to meet us, introduced us to the girls, and we were on our own! There were eight girls, I'd say age 12 to 14. Long story short, they were not impressed by our pep talk, or by the Julie Angel video. Looking back, we probably needed something a bit more action oriented.<br /><br />Once we got them outside though, we started to play some warmup games. Alissa started by having them all run in place, and then drop into the landing position whenever she said drop. We did some side QM, and did some other fun warmup activities. We wanted to start off with a game, so I ran a game of QM Redlight/Greenlight. Went to the fence to do some partner balancing drills, and then we played a balance game. Two people would stand about arms length apart, and try to push each other over without moving their feet. The first person who's feet moved, lost. We then played a finger jousting game, and then I taught precisions.<br /><br />This was the only thing "taught" and "drilled" all day. Later on in Seattle, Rafe Kelly brought up the point that children and adults learn differently. Children are very "lets go go go stop talking and let me do it!" Adults have goals, they want to see progressions, and they want a specific set of steps to get to their goals. When teaching children, at least in the beginning, drilling something will only drive them away. It bores them, and they do not understand why it must be done. I felt it was necessary, however, to "drill" precisions, just for a little bit. We used one end of a sidewalk to another, so it was maybe two feet. I had them jump twice, and then I taught them something new.<br /><br />First I just had them jump. Then I taught them about jumping in an arc, instead of straight to it. I had them jump two more times with this in mind, then I taught them about landing on the balls of the feet. Jump two more times, and then I taught them about bending their legs and compressing. Jump two more times, and that was it. I feel like this was the best way to introduce them to all the necessary concepts. I didn't want to drown them in information, or have them just standing around listening too long, but they needed to know those  three basic concepts. It worked well, too. They didn't get bored, and they had fun with it.<br /><br />As soon as we were done the lesson, the girls got to learn about some practical applications during a game of PDQ. It was a little bit bigger than optimal (8 girls, the director, Alissa, Chad, myself), but it was still a lot of fun, and some of the girls really got into it!<br /><br />PDQ was the last game and activity of the day, and we gave them a quick pep talk, and then left. When the girls started, they were pretty typical pre-teen girls. Completely uninterested and unengaged. By the end, they were running and jumping around, talking and laughing and having fun.<br /><br />I heard back from Alissa yesterday, who just had the second meeting. Apparently, I'm the cute one, because all the girls were asking where I was and when I'd be back. Which is cool....<br /><br />Kinda. :)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.americanparkour.com/teamapk/Happydud/Pictures/Trip/Madison/madgroupmedium.jpg" title="Chad, Zac, Alissa, Lee"><img src="http://www.americanparkour.com/teamapk/Happydud/Pictures/Trip/Madison/madgroupsmall.jpg" tags="Parkour in Madison, Wisconsin"></a>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I arrived at Seattle's airport and called Tyson Cecka, who said he was waiting outside and to give him a call when I got my bag. So I waited. For about fifty minutes. I finally saw my bag coming down the conveyor belt... when someone else grabbed it! See the pictures in the first “Where's Zac” entry for reference, but my bag is pretty easy to identify, and not easy to mix up with someone else's. I started running to intercept them... when I recognized who it was! It was Jesse “Hardcoretraceur” from New York, just with no hair! We went outside and I hopped in the car. Matt Perry from California, Ryan Ford from Colorado, and Tyson Cecka were already inside. After Jesse and I hopped in, I noticed Jereme Sanders from Texas jammed into the trunk. <br /><br />We headed back to Tyson's house and spent the afternoon jamming at Gasworks Park, an old gas refinery station that they converted into essentially a playground. We crashed that night, and then headed off the next morning in a rented MiniCooper to Bellingham, Washington to visit with Rafe Kelly.<br /><br />Rafe is a traceur, but he also trains MovNat (an update to Methode Naturelle). We arrived at his house late in the afternoon, and headed to Whatcom Falls, a huge park with some really awesome trails. We asked Rafe to run us through a Movnat style workout, so we could learn more about it. He explained to us that Movnat was all about replicating Natural Movement. The twelve core parts of MovNat are walking, running, jumping, climbing, quadrupedal movement, balancing, swimming, lifting, carrying, throwing, catching, and defending. Combining these ten real-life activities into a single methodology trains you to be a truly well rounded athlete. Unlike programs that focus on strength and conditioning to get you ready for an activity or sport, in MovNat, performing the activity or sport IS the strength and conditioning. <br /><br />For our warmup, we started off running around a field. There are many ways to run however – forwards, backwards, sideways, rotating, sprinting, jogging. We went from one to another seamlessly, and alternated often. We then progressed into walking movements. This is something I always found confusing – I figured walking was walking. First, we just walked. But then we had to try and move as silently as possible. We then tried to walk, staying as low as possible, then switched it up and pretended to step over something very tall. Next, we combined the two. Pretend you have to step over something very tall, and then crouch and waddle under something very short, and then repeat. We transitioned into QM, and did a lot of QM variations, but also added in some crawling (forwards, left, right, backwards, rolling to the sides) on our elbows and knees which isn't done too often in a lot of Parkour warmups. Standing up into a fighting stance, we practiced bouncing, sliding back, forth, and to the sides, and some punches and crosses. This pretty much wrapped up the warmup, and then we moved onto the workout. <br /><br />Throughout the workout, we moved pretty much constantly. Running through the trails in the woods, balancing on fallen treetrunks and handrails as we went. Several times Rafe had us stop, pick up a rock (a large rock) and we ran with it, passing it off whenever Rafe called out “Pass!” We eventually stopped along the trail, and then practiced lifting. This is very different than lifting weights. When doing a clean and jerk (weight starts on the ground, you pull it up and push it over your head) with a barbell, you have a good hold on the bar and the weight is evenly distributed on the two sides. With a rock, you have to fight to find a decent place to put your hands, the weight is uneven, and we had no idea how heavy it was. Everyone lifted the rock over their head several times, then we played some passing games (just passing the rock down a line). We continued our run, stopping to flip some logs (like telephone poles) and climb up a rock face. We wrapped up the day by finding a big pool of water nxt to some cliff faces about 30 feet up... so we jumped off. A bunch of times.<br /><br />It was a very educational experience, and I think MovNat something that everyone should try to incorporate into their training. I know when I go back to school, I'll be looking for some rocks to carry around.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.americanparkour.com/teamapk/Happydud/Pictures/Trip/Seattle/GroupShot.jpg" title="MovNat Training">]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I walked into the airport in Seattle, ready to fly to San Francisco. I was checking in, and the kiosk I was using gave me the option to change my seat. I mostly fly on the East Coast, and really only on Airtran Airways, and on Airtran it costs money to change your seat. This time however, it was free, so I decided “What the hell” and hit the button. I immediately noticed I was in the back row, all the way on the left. There wasn't even a window, it was almost as if it used to be additional storage, but decided to put half a seat there to make an extra couple of dollars. There were two other seats open, one center seat about 3 rows from the back, and one in center of the very first row of coach. “Hot damn,” I thought, and I grabbed the seat at the front of coach.<br /><br />I got onto my plane, and noticed there was no where in front of me to put my bag, and the flight attendant made me put it in overhead storage (which I hate using). The plane was about half filled when another guy who looked about my age (19) sat down in the window seat next to me. He had kind of scraggly, unkempt hair, and an earring that looked like (and probably was) just a woodchip through his left ear. He sat down next to me, and the flight attendant immediately yelled at him to put his bags up above. We exchanged grumblings about having to put our stuff up, and then we started talking. <br /><br />“It's weird being in an airplane again,” Marty commented, looking around uncomfortably. “In fact it's kind of weird to be surrounded by people.” I asked if it was his first time flying, and he responded “No, I've just been... out of touch with the world for a while.” He then went on to tell me about how he had just spent the past four months by himself in a log cabin in the woods of Northern Minnesota, fifty miles from the nearest road. He told me about how he was in the backwater bar in Minnesota, talking to some loggers. This one logger was telling Marty about his grandfather had built a log cabin up north a long time ago, but no one had had time to go there in fifteen years. Marty thought about it for a second, and then asked the logger “How much?” The logger was a bit taken back, and replied cautiously “Nine hundred dollars?” Marty wrote him a check on the spot, and then met back up with the logger the next day for a topographical map. “It's the only way you can find it,” the logger said. Since it's so far from any roads, you have to find the right hills, follow streams and rivers, and take the correct forks. Marty got some equipment, and then headed off.<br /><br />He arrived in the closest town (50 miles from the cabin) and proceeded to make three trips to the cabin. He was hiking the whole time, so he could only carry so much. He arrived towards the end of winter, and had some trouble the first month. He shot three bucks, but didn't preserve the meat of the first two correctly and the bodies were covered in flies and maggots within 45 minutes. The third one he did right, but had to dry the meat in a corner of his cabin for a month. He said “it smelled like a dead animal.” He paused, and then laughed and added “Well I guess it was a dead animal.” The cabin had a wood stove, a wooden desk, some candles, and not much else. <br /><br />He spent a lot of time cleaning up the cabin and the surrounding area (no one had been there for 15 years), and spent the rest of his days hunting small game (rabbit, squirrel), fishing (in lakes so clear you could see 30 feet below the surface), and exploring. He told me about how he used a series of pink bandannas to tie around trees, so he could find his way home. When exploring, he'd tie them around trees as he was about to get out of sight of the previous one. On the way back home, he'd untie and collect them, leaving no trace he was ever there. When he arrived back home, he would sit at his desk and read books, write, and draw. <br /><br />He had the most amazing books. He had several books of Plato and Socrates, he also had a book, done in the same conversation-style of Plato, about the differences between Plato's time and “modern times,” and whether or not the same philosophies were applicable. The book was written in the 1700s. He had a book, first edition, from the 1890s. He showed me a book called “Two Minutes Till Midnight” which was written, I think in the 1930s, about the horrors of hydrogen bomb. Well before the Manhattan Project was even started. Almost every book Marty had taken with him to his cabin was written before 1950, and most of them were first editions. I'm not huge into antiques and old things, but just holding a book that was printed in 1890 was an amazing experience. Paging carefully through it, examining paper and ink so durable it lasted 120 years, and was still in excellent condition, was a very cool experience. Then I realized the book I was holding was six times older than I was. It gave me a whole new appreciation for old books. Very, very cool.<br /><br />He mentioned again how strange it was to be back in society, and I asked him why he left his cabin. He made it through winter, and it was summer now so food must not be a problem. He looked at me, smiled sheepishly, and replied “I ran out of books to read.” That was the only reason he left. Because he needed more books. So he trekked back to town, called his parents who, when they found out it was him, said “Oh, good. You're still alive.” They bought him a ticket to visit his uncle in San Francisco. Marty is convinced their ulterior motive was to convince him to get a job and settle down. Marty's reason for agreeing to go to San Francisco was because he heard there were some awesome used book stores there. He was going to hang out for a few weeks, buy a bunch more books, sell enough art on the street to finance a ticket back to Minneapolis, and then go back to his cabin.<br /><br />Then he asked me why I was going to San Francisco, and I told him about Parkour, about my trip, and I showed him some videos I had stored on my laptop. He was absolutely enthralled. He was really excited and enthusiastic, and thought Parkour and my trip was pretty much the coolest thing ever. Frankly, I disagree, and I think living in a cabin in the woods is pretty much the coolest thing ever, but Parkour comes in a close second. After watching some more videos and listening to me explain it a bit more, he realized that he had been doing something similar in the woods. His goal was to, save the cabin, leave no trace that he was there (the bandannas are a good example). When he moved through the forest, which was completely wild and untamed, he climbed, crawled and jumped in order to get around without damaging the environment. Often when he was tracking a deer, he had to move silently, slowly, and be totally aware of his environment so he didn't scare his prey away. It wasn't exactly Parkour, but his goals were basically the same. Move efficiently through his environment. In his case, efficiency meant silence and without cutting, breaking, or snapping anything.<br /><br />We decided, as we were landing, that we were the most interesting “single serving friends” we'd ever had. I got his phone number and email so I could invite him to the San Francisco monthly jam that was happening that weekend. The next morning, before I called him, I saw a used bookstore. I wandered in, and saw their “First Editions” collection. I looked through the titles and saw Jack Keuroak (s?)'s “On The Road Again.” Autographed. I considered purchasing it as a gift, if we were able to meet up.<br /><br />I emailed him but he never emailed me back, and I called a few times but his voice-mail was full (which doesn't surprise me. He was gone for four freaking months) and he never picked up.<br /><br />I guess Marty will truly remain a single serving friend. My best, single serving, friend.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Texas National Jam Write up</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Texas Parkour held their National Jam in San Antonio this year, Friday July 25th through Sunday the 27th. Over 75 people showed up throughout the weekend, coming in from all over Texas and the rest of the country. San Antonio, Houston, Austin, and Dallas all had a strong presence, and traceurs flew or drove in from Arizona, Colorado, Oklahoma, Maryland and Michigan. <br />  <br />People started arriving Friday morning, and kept streaming in throughout the day. Jereme Sander's house was used as a staging ground for everyone, who stayed entertained while waiting for people with Jereme's trampoline and Zachary Cohn's slackline (although most of the adventure was in putting up the slackline. Knots are a very important thing to remember how to tie!). By 7pm, everyone had shown up (save KC Parsons, from Michigan, who earned the nickname “Chicago” after everyone kept thinking he was from Chicago), and we left for University of Texas: San Antonio campus for some night conditioning. <br /><br />The focus here was not so much Parkour, but showing everyone how hard you could, and should, train. A lot of people who train Parkour either don't condition, or don't really know how. This is unfortunate, because conditioning your body for Parkour is so important – how we consider ourselves athletes but do nothing except for skillwork. Football, soccer, and lacrosse players all do non-skill conditioning work... what makes Traceurs any different? This “conditioning” night session was intended to teach people about conditioning and show them how they can be creative with their environment and still train hard.<br /><br />We started off with a warmup, which transitioned into a workout. There was running (forwards, backwards, sideways), Quadrupedal movement (forwards, backwards, sideways), “PK Gen Style” push-ups (see: Philly Jam video for examples), hopping, and jumping. We moved onto balancing on some rails, both bipedally (standing and in a duck-walk position), quadrupedally, keeping track of your falls. For each time you fell, at the end you did 10 pushups or squats. Traversal practice was next, from a cat hang position people would shimmy across a wall, which would angle downwards (or upwards depending which side you were on), at about a 45 degree angle. <br /><br />Eventually, we traveled to a large set of stairs, broken into two 14 step sections divided by a landing. Jereme showed everyone a workout he borrowed from Forrest of Parkour Generations. Everyone starts at the bottom of the steps in a squat position, and then using only your feet and hands (so you remain in a squat position in the air), jump up a step when the leader calls out “Up one!” If the leader calls out “Up two!” then go up two steps. However, sometimes you'll hear “Down one!” or “Down two!” and you have to jump backwards some steps. After this, more stair work. Hopping up all the stairs, one step at a time, with one foot, and then doing pushup hops down (hands on the top step, do a pushup, and when you are exploding up, your entire body hops forward a bit and your hands land on the next step down). Hop up the steps again with your other leg, and then QM down. Instead of resting while everyone else finished, once you completed everything you would just run up and down the steps, with more and more people joining as they completed the stair workout. This was wrapping up the night, and everyone circled up for a group cool down stretch. After about 30 minutes of stretching, people hung around for a bit, jammed, had fun, and then we headed back to Jereme's house around midnight for sleep. <br /><br />The goal was to leave at 9am the next morning for Hemisfair Park. The convoy left around 9:30 (which was when we REALLY needed to leave anyway, we figured we'd be getting out a bit late) and showed up at the park around 10. By the time the convoy from Jereme's house got there, twenty people were already there, jumping around! Because there were so many people there (at one count, 55), we split into two groups. One group stayed at the meeting location, and the other headed to the other side of the park where there was a wooden Castle-style playground. Everyone in the first group spread out and worked on different things. Chris Salvato and Zac Cohn led a brief balancing workshop for a few newer tracuers, introducing newer concepts like shuffling along the rail sideways, instead of always forwards and backwards. Another Chris, from Oklahoma, was being coached on his dive kongs and double kongs. People were drilling cats and step up cranes, and there were really traceurs just scampering everywhere. After a bit, the two groups switched (but the second group came back to the wooden castle pretty quickly, they were asked to leave the area they were in), and everyone trained together at the playground. <br /><br />People were nailing some pretty impressive cats and precisions, while on the other side of the playground some of the Huston crowd were drilling kong to cats when a police officer parked her car right next to us. She stepped out, made sure we weren't going to run into her car, and then hung out and chatted with us for a bit. Soon, a second officer came over and joined the conversation. They seemed genuinely interested, and the second officer told us a story from when he was young on the force. He was making a drug arrest, and the suspect ran. He proceeded on a footchase, but soon was weighed down by all of his equipment and started to overheat in his uniform long sleeved shirt and long pants. We discussed why, as recruits and trainees, they run all the time in shorts and t-shirts, but rarely do any training in full equipment. I thought that this drew an interesting parallel to traceurs who change into their “Parkour shoes” and where special shoes whenever they train. Would these people suffer the same problem? Being unable to perform to their maximum capacity because they didn't train in what they usually wear? <br /><br />We wrapped up at the playground and headed out for a late lunch. Jereme then suggested we all go cliff diving, so we piled back in the cars and parked on this seemingly abandoned country road. We crossed the street and headed into the woods, eventually finding a trail down to a boulder-filled stream. After jumping from boulder to boulder for a while, we were able to cross to the other side and pick up another trail that led us to a much deeper stream, surrounded by cliffs. The cliffs ranged from 3 feet above the water to 30, and anyone who didn't feel like climbing and flipping into the river had a relaxing afternoon soaking in the warm stream. Many gainers, double fronts, and full twists later, we piled back in the cars and headed to dinner, then Jereme's house for sleep. <br /><br />Getting up early AGAIN on Sunday morning, we left the house around 9:20 and drove to Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas. The heat was starting to some people, but everyone still got out and trained hard. San Marcos was a lot of fun, a lot of interesting architecture, and a lot of awesome rails. Breakfast hadn't really happened yet, so we left a bit earlier and got burritos, then headed to another nearby wooden castle park where Jereme led a warmup and Matthew Lee Willis led a game or two of follow the leader. There was an article in a local newspaper about the jam, and a couple people were there waiting for us. Some people were there just to watch, but other people hoped to join in – they were just a bit intimidated. With a bit of encouragement, some of them joined in the fun and had a great introduction to Parkour! <br /><br />We left the park and met up again at a river running through one of the nearby schools. There was a bit of swimming, followed mostly by a tricking session in very wet grass. There was enough traction to trick fine, but clothes and legs and feet got soaked. This resulted in some pretty cool explosions of water when people's feet started whipping around. At one point, Jereme set up a line of about 8 people, and everyone backtucked simultaneously, water shooting into the sky. <br /><br />The day fin
ished up as everyone went back to Mike Avery's house. We hung out there for a few hours before a midnight trip to IHOP, where there were plenty of “Yo Momma” jokes (Yo momma's so fat that my dog bit her and died of high cholesterol.), a creepy waiter, and a really super creepy older guy. When he started hitting on some of the traceuses present and getting into an argument with Chris Holden about the military we decided it was a good time to leave. We parted ways, and the Texas Parkour National Jam finally ended.<br /><br />Overall, it was very, very hot. People did a ton of pushups due to “the Game” (if you say certain words, you have to do 10 pushups. No I won't tell you what they are, because I don't want to do them! They're all negative words though, and the game is played with the surface goal of fostering a more positive attitude. It's really just an excuse to make people do pushups though.), with Desmund Mitchell racking up 350 at one point. They started selling the newest Texas Parkour t-shirt (a sunset, with a silhouetted traceur vaulting a cow) We sweat a lot, and drank approximately seven hundred gallons of water. A ton of people showed up, and it was a huge success. <br /><br />I'd definitely back to Texas – although maybe I'll wait until Winter.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I got to the train station in Georgia at 7:30pm, Tuesday the 5th. I arrived in Burlington, North Carolina at 10:00am, Wednesday the 6th. It was a looong train ride. I saw TK17/Duncan waiting for me as the train pulled up, I recognized him from his Pilgrimage video. We all got introduced, and then headed to IHOP for breakfast (my first meal in almost 15 hours). Most of Wednesday was spent resting, and I led a small training session at UNC – Chapel Hill that evening showcasing some of the different training methods I'd learned on my trip. The real adventure of North Carolina happened Thursday, though.<br /><br />We left around 9am from Duncan's house in three cars. The plan was to rendezvous with two other people, and then go hiking all day at Table Rock, a huge series of mountains and rocks, with a valley containing the “North Carolina Wall.” The trip started off well enough, and then we hit a bump. <br /><br />Two of the cars were already full, the third car had enough room for the two extra passengers we were picking up. The third car also happened to develop a transmission problem that prevented it from shifting out of second gear. This pretty much makes it an adventure to get out of your neighborhood. We parked it at a Dairy Cream off of the highway, and reconsolidated passengers, then headed to pick up the two extra people. <br /><br />They were waiting in a parking lot of a strip mall, and as we pulled up we realized a new problem. Since the car broke down, we now had 9 seats and 11 people. I spent the next 3 hours of our journey to Table Rock in the trunk of a Honda Element. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.americanparkour.com/teamapk/Happydud/Pictures/Trip/NC/Element.jpg" title="Honda Element"><br /><br />Only one person knows how to get there, and he's in the other car. After about two and a half hours, we start to question whether or not this place exists, because we see no tables, rocks, or mountains that look like either. We finally start seeing signs of the mountain, and we begin our ascent. For a while, the paved road was steep and winding as we head up the mountain, but then it turned into more of a dust road than a dirt one. Driving up and down this winding dirt road created a massive dust cloud behind us, obscuring vision. Again, after about a half an hour we started to question if we were actually headed anywhere in particular, or just out for a nice drive.  <br /><br /><img src="http://www.americanparkour.com/teamapk/Happydud/Pictures/Trip/NC/Dust.jpg" title="North Carolina Loves Happydud"><br /><br />Finally, we arrived at a parking lot, and saw a sign for “Table Rock Trail.” We made it to the trail! We piled out of the car, which was completely covered in dust at this point, and started out our hike. Several people decided to do it barefoot, so I join them, kicking off my shoes, tying the laces together and slinging them over my shoulder. We reached several photo-op spots, using a bit of creative climbing and Parkour to get on top of boulders. Almost every time it seemed like we had reached the top of the mountain and everything else was descending, but every time we kept going further and every time the view got more and more spectacular. <br /><br />At one point, our first real view of the valley, there was a rock-peninsula about 100 feet ahead and parallel to of us. Duncan and two other traceurs climbed down the rock face we were resting on, traversed their way through the brush and thorns, and then climbed out to it. It must have been a fantastic view, with nothing obstructing their vision. We continued the climb, and after getting distracted probably fifteen times by interesting Parkour spots or climbing walls, we eventually made it to the end. This was definitely the best view of the entire hike. We were out on a corner of a cliff with the entire valley stretched to our right, and another set of mountains reaching up to our left. We stayed there for probably twenty minutes, just taking in the sights. From valleys to falcons, it was nature at its finest. <br /><br />It was also dinner time. We'd been out hiking for close to four hours, with a four hour drive before that. We were famished! So before starting the trek down the mountain, we broke open a cooler in the trunk of the other car and got to work on our picnic! It was a great picnic, with turkey, ham, assorted fruits and vegetables, bread and some cookies for desert. After eating, we piled back into the cars, I got back into my trunk, and we were comin' back down the mountain. I almost immediately curled up in the trunk of the Honda Element and passed out. (and let me tell you, waking up in the trunk of a Honda Element is probably one of the strangest things you'll ever experience). <br /><br />A quick stop at Dairy Queen to pick up the car (and for ice cream), and we headed back to Duncan's house to pass out. I left the next morning for home, and I definitely think that the hike was a fantastic way to end my summer adventure. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.americanparkour.com/teamapk/Happydud/Pictures/Trip/NC/Group.jpg" title="Zac Cohn and North Carolina Parkour">]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Interest in Parkour at RIT is exploding. <br /><br />We are not a school sponsored club, although we are working on it, but through grassroots advertising and word of mouth alone, the size of our regular meetings has doubled since last spring. This explosion in popularity is not just limited to RIT however. I have been in contact with many people from University of Rochester, Monroe Community College, and people from around the city. <br /><br /><b>In an effort to expand awareness of Parkour even more, I have decided to launch a new website, <a href="http://www.RochesterParkour.com" title="Rochester Parkour">www.RochesterParkour.com</a></b><br /><br />This website will serve as the central hub for all Parkour activities in the Rochester, New York area. We are not a team or a clan, we are simply a community. This website will function as a way to promote Parkour in Rochester, and to direct people who might be interested, but are unsure of where to start, to willing and able teachers. It will be a single website where they can read articles, look at pictures, and watch videos all relevant to the Rochester area. There will be information about workshops and classes being offered, as well as regular training times and locations.<br /><br />The site is still new, and things will be constantly added. Soon I will be adding an "Articles" section, as well as "Quotes" and a link to our pictures, hosted on Flickr.<br /><br />In addition to hosting content for the Rochester community, the site links to other valuable resources such as <a href="http://www.AmericanParkour.com" title="American Parkour">American Parkour</a>, blogs of local and high-profile traceurs (someone who trains Parkour), and other websites.<br /><br />My hope is that this new site will spark even more interest in Parkour in the Rochester area, and will help people train in a safe and responsible manner.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Zenith Parkour Class - A Big Hit</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On Sunday, October 5th, I ran a free "Parkour and Obstacle Coursing Workshop" at <a href="http://www.zenith-gym.com/" title="Zenith Gymnastics">Zenith Gymnastics</a> in Rochester, New York.<br /><br />I've been working with Zenith Gymnastics through the RIT Gymnastics club since the end of last summer. I was calling all the local gyms I could find, trying to find somewhere that would give us access to their equipment and facilities and let us train there. After some negotiation, RIT Gymnastics started going there weekly, learning from Sasha and Maria Kourbatova - Russian olympic gold metalists and leaders in their fields. We learned a lot over the year, and we're looking forward to a very successful second year with them!<br /><br />Amy, the owner of Zenith Gymnastics, has been trying to expand her boys program. My roommate, co-founder of <a href="http://www.RochesterParkour.com" title="Rochester Parkour">Rochester Parkour</a>, and President of the RIT Gymnastics Club <a href="http://www.charlesmoreland.com" title="Charles Moreland's blog">Charles Moreland</a>, offered his help and has begun to teach some of the Boy's Gymnastics classes at Zenith. <br /><br />Back in August, I called Amy to confirm plans for Gymnastics this year. At the end of this call, I proposed to her the idea of starting a Parkour class. She was interested in the idea, and told me to develop a curriculum and some flyers. I came up with several different ways for the class to work, depending on some of Amy's goals, and we finally settled on a 4 week class aimed towards Zenith's primary demographic, 8-14 year olds.<br /><br />Yesterday, I ran a free workshop at Zenith to generate some interest. Five kids arrived, and there were between eight and ten more on the list of people interested. Two brothers, around age 9, two fourteen year olds, and a seven year old.<br /><br />We started with some fun running drills up and down the gym, then I introduced them to QM (Quadrupedal Motion). We did more of what I called a "gorilla run," a fast and galloping motion. After a minute or two of practice with this, I wanted to start getting them engaged.<br /><br /><p>One thing I've learned in my experience with Taekwondo is that kids are very easily distracted. In fact, I've made a chart:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://zaccohn.com/pics/AttentionSpanGraph.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 200px;" src="http://zaccohn.com/pics/AttentionSpanGraph.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br /><br />You can't argue with science this sound.<br /><br />In order to keep the kids entertained and on topic, I mixed a lot of games into the class. The first game we played is QM Tag. You have to stay on all fours, and then the person who is it has to tag someone's elbows. They enjoyed this a lot, and it was a great way to warm them up.<br /><br />After a few other warmup activities, we moved straight into an obstacle course.<br />I started by showing them a simple safety vault over a balance beam, and then they landed, immediately QMed under a second balance beam, and then stood up and vaulted over a third. After that, pull-overs on the uneven bars, QM-balance on a balance beam (floor height), jumping over some blocks, some more qm, and then some precision jumps to and from tape on the floor.<br /><br />We broke it down, piece by piece, so A) I could teach them some of the basics of a technique to overcome that obstacle, and B) so I could make sure they were doing it safely. The only thing people really had problems with was the pull-overs, and so I stood there and assisted them.<br /><br />Later on, we played a game of PDQ (a game where the goal is to jump on people's feet), ran through another obstacle course, climbed ropes, and jumped in a foam pit!<br /><br />The two brothers picked it up immediately. While I only showed them the safety vault, they were already modifying it into what looked like a two-handed speed vault. They plowed through all the vaulting and QM and balance. Later on, we were practicing rope climbs. Once they were done and waiting for the other three boys, they asked me if they could practice the pull-overs. I don't really know why this left such an impression on me, but I told them of course they could and watched as they figured out how to do it themselves!<br /><br />The two fourteen year olds did quite well also, they had some problems with the rope climb and the pull-overs, but they didn't give up! That's another thing that really left an impact on me. Even when they couldn't do it, they were thinking about how to practice or how to build enough strength to do it. I can barely remember all these kids' names, and I'm already so proud of them.<br /><br />All in all, it was a great experience. The kids had an enormous amount of fun and were really excited about coming back (one of them even signed up for the www.AmericanParkour.com forums already... I didn't even reference it! He must be doing his own research) Amy is very excited about Zenith being the only gym with a Parkour class for 400 miles (er, 200 miles. Stupid Toronto...), and I'm very excited to be teaching it!<br /><br />For now, there's only one class a week: Sunday's at 1PM. The age range is 8-14 (although I'm sure plus or minus a year won't hurt much). If you are interested in a class, but you or your child is not within this age range, email me at zac@rochesterparkour.com and call Zenith and let us know. If there is enough interest, we would love to open up more classes.<br /><br />If you are interested in registering for the Zenith Gymnastics Parkour and Obstacle Coursing Class, please call Zenith at 585-292-5370 and let them know! Zenith Gymnastics is located in Winton Place just off the East end of Brighton Henrietta Townline Road.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Before I get started on this article, I just want to point people who know what Trigger Points are to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0683083678?ie=UTF8&tag=zaccom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0683083678" title="The Myofascial Pain and Dysfunction: The Trigger Point Manual">The Myofascial Pain and Dysfunction: The Trigger Point Manual</a>, which is hands now the best book about Myofascial Trigger Points that there is. There are two volumes, one for upper body and one for the lower body.

You can lie to yourself, but deep down, you know what it is. Your elbow, knee, or some other part of your body is always hurting. For a while, it was only right after you were physically active. <br /><br />That's normal, right? It just means a good workout. <br /><br />Then it started to hurt during a workout. <br /><br />That's not a big deal. I'll just rest it for a day or two, then I'll be good.<br /><br />But after a few days of rest, it's starting to hurt all the time. When you wake up, when you're watching TV, when you're at school or trying to go to sleep. Even now, a lot of times you'll lie to yourself. <br /><br />I'll rest it for a week, I'm just training harder and my body isn't quite used to it. <br /><br />It feels a bit better after the week, then you start training again and it immediately gets worse.<br /><br />Finally, you can't lie to yourself anymore. It's some sort of chronic injury. This scenario describes overuse injuries, but there are all sorts of causes for chronic injuries. It could have been a single injury that never fully heals right, or it could just occur over time due to poor posture. <br /><br />Chronic injuries, to put it bluntly, suck. There are so many possible causes for “sore elbows” it's not even funny. You can go to ten different medical professionals and get fifteen different diagnoses. Tendonitis, tendonosis, tight forearm muscles, tight upper arm muscles, weak back muscles, back muscles that are too strong, weak triceps, triceps that are too strong, shoulders that are rolled too far forwards, shoulders that are rolled too far back... you get the idea. <br /><br />The worst part is that most chronic injuries will never fully heal on their own. You'll always be dealing with it. Every day, people quit running, or climbing, or tennis or whatever their favorite activity is because it causes too much pain. Quitting often doesn't even help address and fix the problem, it just helps prevent it from getting worse.<br /><br />I've been dealing with elbow problems for close to 9 months now. They developed due to a combination of factors (which is pretty common, a lot of bad things stacking on top each other), but it was primarily from bouldering (rock climbing). Way too much. <br /><br />WAAAAAAYYYYY TOO MUCH.<br /><br />Going from having never climbed, to climbing “two hours a day, five days a week, for ten weeks” too much. In retrospect, it was dumb. Really dumb. But it was winter in Rochester, New York. It was cold, and there was nothing to do at night except climb.<br /><br />There were certainly other factors that contributed to it. I didn't stretch after I went climbing, and usually I biked about 2 miles home in sub-freezing temperatures. I sat at my computer with my elbows dangling off the side of the desk. A few other things as well, but it was definitely primarily the climbing.<br /><br />I didn't notice anything until week 8 or so. I might have taken a day or two off, but I just pushed through it. The quarter ended, and Charlie came back home with me for Spring Break. We did a lot of parkour training then, and my elbows kept hurting more and more. I finally recognized that this was a problem, and stopped all activity for a while. I thought it was okay around week 4 or 5 of Spring quarter, started doing some things, relapsed. Since then, I've been taking upper body work very easily, barely doing anything with my arms unless I absolutely needed to. <br /><br />It helped, but not much. The constant pain went away, but whenever there was any sort of activity, it'd hurt again. <br /><br />I started reading about other solutions. Everything from surgery to injecting the tendons with a saline solution, which was supposed to fix all tendon problems via pseudo-magic. Then I started reading about trigger point therapy. <br /><br />Trigger point therapy is a type of massage that has been around officially for about 40 or 50 years, but has roots and influences all the way back to ancient China's acupuncture. It essentially is the study of “knots” in muscles and tendons - how they effect the body, how to find them, and how to allow them to release. These aren't the knots that your girlfriend massages out of your back though (although those are common trigger points). These trigger points are often located deep inside a muscle, or under the shoulder blade. Sometimes you have to release a smaller one to get the muscle to relax enough to access the other ones you want. Finding one usually results in pin-point pain, and with constant pressure over a period of time, the pain decreases (sometimes it increases before it decreases) as the trigger point starts to release. <br /><br />A good way to understand what exactly trigger points, or knots, are, is the rubber band analogy. Take a rubber band, pinch it with your thumb and forefinger. Now with your other hand, grab the other side and stretch. The rubber band stretches, except for the point that you're pinching - that's still tight. Now imagine that the rubber band is a tendon or muscle, and that tight spot being pinched is a trigger point. These knots can be created by any of the things we talked about earlier – overuse, injury, poor posture, improper care of your body.<br /><br />Though the name may sound like it, Trigger Points are not energetic sites as one finds in Chinese acupuncture or Indian ayervedic medicine.  They are physical bodies, of tight and perpetually contracting tissue that can be palpated, or massaged, directly.  The existence of Trigger Points have been recognized ever since we figured out that kneading and pressing on muscles and tissues feels good and helps rid us of aches and pains.  <br /><br />They have been treated in some form or another with every type of bodywork, including traditional Chinese medicine practices, Anma (the original type of official massage performed exclusively by blind men in Asia), thousands of years ago. But until real research on treatment options began in the 1960s, there was no physiological proof of trigger points. The study and therapy of Myofascial Trigger Points is medical science, not mysticism. You don’t need to “believe” in it – the treatment either works, or it doesn’t. Trigger points are identifiable, verifiable, and the problems they create are very predictable.  In short, trigger points are very real.<br /><br />An important part of trigger point therapy is what is called “referred pain.” That means that if your elbow hurts, it might be because there is a trigger point in your back. If you have ankle pain, it could be in your calf, or your quads. There are entire books full of diagrams of referred pain patterns. If there is pain here and here, the likely trigger point is over here, etc. Referred pain exists because the body is a single, interconnected ball of organic matter. If that rubber band has a knot in it, it can go anywhere from causing discomfort or pain to physically limiting range of motion. Your body will naturally shift posture try to compensate and avoid pain or reclaim that range of motion, and this can often cause even more muscle imbalances, posture issues, and problems.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.zaccohn.com/pics/thumbReferredPain.gif"><br /><br />According to medical research over the last 50 years (and especially in the past 15-20), between 75% and 80% of myofascial pain is due, at least in part, to trigger points. A lot of times something is diagnosed as tendonisis, arthritis, or bursitis, but it's really due to trigger points. <br /><br />I read this, and started thinking about my elbow problem. I hung out in a  Barnes and Noble for three hours and read a couple books about it, learned a fair amount. It's hard to apply to yourself, however, especially with no formal instruction and only a few hours of book learning. <br /><br />And then I met Graham Musler. He is a student at Monroe Community College who was interested in Parkour. He came out to train with us one day, and while we were walking back to the car, we started talking.  Turns out, he had graduated from Monroe Community College with an A.A.S in massage therapy, and then spent an additi
onal year at the Pittsburgh School of Pain Management studying Myofascial Trigger Point Therapy.<br /><br />Coincidence? I think not.<br /><br />I've had three appointments with him so far, and each one has done wonders for my elbows. They're not better yet, but they've made huge amounts of progress. I've also learned tons about my body. There's one trigger point in the upper back where, when pressed, you feel pain (but good pain) shoot from the trigger point, up your neck, around the back of your head, and around your ear. It's absolutely fascinating to not see, but feel, how all of the muscles, tendons, ligaments, and bones are connected and how intricately they work together.<br /><br />Last session, he was working a trigger point on latissimus dorsi (lats, side of the torso), and I felt one of the more painful spots on my arm start to tingle and release. This is an area I never thought would effect my elbow... but it does. <br /><br />A lot of people don't believe Trigger Point therapy is a real, valid treatment. I say, from experience, those people are wrong. I'm not 100% fixed yet, but the progress I've already seen is proof enough for me. Trigger Point really focuses on addressing the causes of the problem, not just the symptoms like many other treatment methods do.<br /><br />As a way of saying thanks to Graham, I'm going to post his contact information here. If you have any sort of chronic pain or lasting acute injury, please do yourself a favor and contact him. If you just want more information on self-care, trigger points, or any other treatment he offers, shoot him an email.  After the first session, I guarantee you'll recognize the value. Would you prefer living the rest of your life in pain, preventing you from doing what you enjoy? Or take a chance and give Graham an hour of your time.<br /><br /><b>Contact info:<br />Graham Musler<br />585.520.1020<br />touchworks@live.com<br /><br />Services offered:<br />Myofascial Trigger Point Therapy<br />Chinese Acupressure<br />Friction, Pressure, & Pull<br />Lomi Lomi Hot Stone Therapy<br />Thai Massage Therapy<br />Sandstone Rejuvinate Therapy</b>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>72 Hour Fast</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My name is Zachary Cohn, and I have never been hungry. <br /><br />I don't think I've ever gone more than 18 hours without food. Even during religious holidays when fasting was encouraged, it was only sun-up to sun-down (and I'd sneak food throughout the day anyway). I've wanted to eat before, my stomach has told me it was empty and needed more food to sustain it. Even right now, my stomach is growling a bit, even though I ate less than 2 hours ago. <br /><br />Food is actually a fairly significant part of my life. I eat healthy and I love to cook. I pride myself on having never drank a soda. My roommates and I regularly cook our own dinners, ranging from calzones (made from scratch!) to oven-baked chicken with a homemade alfredo sauce. We eat healthy, and we eat a LOT. <br /><br />I live in an upper-middle class household where there have always been cans in the cabinet, apples on the table, and milk in the refrigerator. I've made enough money so if I'm out, I don't have to deliberate and decide if I can afford to eat out somewhere or if I should just hold out and wait until I get home. Food has always been an arm's reach away. <br /><br />I was at a bookstore <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/031218719X?ie=UTF8&tag=zaccom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=031218719X">looking at this book</a> last week when my stomach growled and I decided I was hungry. This time though, for some reason, I thought about my last thought. "I am hungry." Four hours before, I had eaten a 3 egg omelet with cheese, turkey, and peppers. There was no way I was "hungry" again. This is when I realized that I've never truly been hungry. Starving children in Africa, to use the cliche, have gone days without food. People tortured in POW Camps have been deprived of food for days at a time. <br /><br />Running out of peanut butter and jelly that morning suddenly seemed like not as big of a deal.<br /><br />That's when I made my decision. I was going to fast. Not for any religious reason. Not for health or weight loss or purification. Just to see if I can do it. To see if I have the willpower to not eat for a full 72 hours.<br /><br />I hope this will do a few things for me. <br /><br />First, I think it will ultimately be satisfying. My training for Parkour goes beyond simply running and vaulting over stuff. I train Parkour so I can be ready for anything that happens. Parkour alone won't do this, which is why I do a variety of activities (Parkour, martial arts, rock climbing, lifting, slacklining, even swing dance and juggling). When called upon to act, I want the ability to perform and meet the demands of the situation. If the situation is not having food available... I want to know what it feels like. I want to be ready.<br /><br />Side note - I'm interested in deprivation training. In the coming months, I hope to spend a full 24 hours with various disabilities. I want to go one day without sight, another without thumbs, with only my non-dominant hand, and without my lower body. But for the next 72 hours, I'll be going without food.<br /><br />Second, I think this will allow me to control my desire to eat better. A lot of times I find myself eating just because there's food around, or because i have nothing else to do, or because it's "that time of day" when I usually eat and I feel obligated to eat. I want to break that habit. This will hopefully give me a frame of reference. Which leads into the next reason...<br /><br />Two point Five, this will also be a test of willpower. I am not removing food from my life, I am just not consuming it. I will be around food fairly often. I will be going to the dining hall with friends, I will be eating dinner with my roommates, perhaps even cooking food with them. Being around food, but not eating, will probably be the hardest part of all. Several people have said it would be cooler if I went into a jungle or into the desert and did this... but at that point eating is simply not an option. In my case, eating IS an option, and yet I choose not to eat.<br /><br />Third, I want to know hunger. It's an experience that most people in society never know. zNo one I interact with knows, has ever known, or will ever know hunger. I'm not kidding myself, three days is nothing. People can go 15, 20 days without food. I'm not willing to sacrifice and damage my body to that intensity, but I feel like this will at least be a taste of what true hunger feels like. To really understand what I mean, please read <a href="http://www.365tomorrows.com/09/27/bug-catching/" title="Bug Catching">this short story</a> (it's 7 paragraphs, and it does an excellent job describing what I'm talking about). <br /><br />Because of these reasons, because I consider this experiment "training," I'm not going to be changing my daily routine. In fact, I'm going to become more strict. I am going to wake up and get up when my alarm goes off. I will continue biking to and from school each day. I am going to get to every class on time. I am going to get to work on time. I will also be attending the activities I usually participate in those evenings. Wednesday is juggling night, Thursday is swing dance, and Friday is Taekwondo (although this one I teach in, so I won't be actively participating in all of the drills). I will not be eating a huge dinner tonight, just my normal meal. I'm not going to prepare for this at all, I want it to be as though eating was suddenly no longer an option, yet I had to continue on as normal, as if I was fighting in a war and we ran out of rations (although slightly less intense).<br /><br />I'm publicizing this for a few reasons. I hope I make other people to think about hunger. I don't necessarily want everyone to join me in my fast or in a fast of their own, but I do want people to recognize that they probably have never truly been hungry in their life. <br /><br />I've posted a link on <a href="http://digg.com/food_drink/Man_fasts_for_72_hours" title="Man Fasts for 72 Hours">Digg</a> to my <a href="http://www.twitter.com/zacharycohn" title="Zachary Cohn's Twitter">Twitter</a>, where I will be making regular updates about how I'm feeling. I hope this will help the information get out, but I also hope this will hold me publicly accountable and be added incentive to stick to it. <br /><br />I'll be updating twitter pretty often, and on Saturday, after my fast is over, I will be posting here again with all the twitter updates, and a "wrap up" summarizing how it went and what I learned.<br /><br />[Edit - Read <a href="http://www.zaccohn.com/2008/11/72-hour-fast-part-2.html" title="Part One of the 72 Hour Fast">Part One</a> and <a href="http://www.zaccohn.com/2008/11/72-hour-fast-part-3.html" title="Part Two of the 72 Hour Fast">Part Two</a> of my twitter-logs from my fast] ]]></content:encoded>

I understand your motivation--with all of us cushy-assed middle-classers whining about the economy going crappy and not being able to buy big-screen TVs and SUVs like we used to, we tend to forget that most of the globe is worse off than any of us ever have been or will be. This is a journey of personal discovery for you, and it's very deep of you to look at it this way. But I like your blog, so don't end up in the emergency room because konging a picnic table is one thing, depriving your body of something it is used to for an extended period of time is another. Oh yeah, this is GT from Addicted to Chai! I haven't updated in a while cause I'm also busy with school now. Good  luck.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Great Job with the fast.  I remember doing some methode acting back in college and I was basically in a post apocalyptic world.  The character I was playing only ate once a day.  It was not 72 hours but I only got to eat 2 bits of chicken on stage during the play.  That was not too hard but it was a test.  So, congratulations for making it this far, really great job.<br/><br/>Down here in Austin we try to incorporate some restrictive training.  We do some blind training at least once a month.  the *without thumbs* sounds fun.  I did many things like this while in college.  Though, I did them as performance art.  One day I juggled every time I walked.  I walk backwards an entire day.  I will however be doing a QM all day in the future.<br/><br/>Best of luck to you and way to go!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Here are the Twitter updates from the 72 hour period (and a little before). In a few days, I'll post up my reflections on what I learned, and plans for the future.<br /><br />I'm anxious about fasting for 72 hours. I have 4 hours and 57 more minutes of foodtime left, and then nothing until Saturday.   7:03 PM Oct 28th<br /><br />Just set up my phone. I will be constantly updating this twitter with how i feel during my 72 hour fast. Visit www.zaccohn.com to find more.   7:17 PM Oct 28th<br /><br />is hungry and tired already... and he hasn't even begun his fast yet! This is going to suck.   9:30 PM Oct 28th<br /><br />I'm home for the night. It's timeto pee, then start making the last supper. One hour and five minutes.   10:55 PM Oct 28th <br /><br />I'm starting to eat dinner now... Cutting it a bit close   11:54 PM Oct 28th<br /><br />Here we go...   12:00 AM Oct 29th <br /><br />First morning: Woke up on time, showered, and ready for class 25 minutes early. I forgot how long breakfast takes to prepare. A bit peckish.   7:35 AM Oct 29th<br /><br />Just finished his first bike ride to class. Current weather: hail. Good game, Rochester... Good game.   8:16 AM Oct 29th <br /><br />I'm feeling the first urges to eat. It's been eight hours and fifty five minutes since i last ate.   8:50 AM Oct 29th <br /><br />I just made it through my first hunger headache. Nothing special, I get these all the time when I skip breakfast. Signs of things to come... 10:10 AM Oct 29th from web<br /><br />Twelve hours down. Sixty to go. No real issues yet.   10:10 PM Oct 29th <br /><br />Perhaps going to lunch with my friends was a bad idea... That's an awful good looking bowl of pasta.   1:09 PM Oct 29th<br /><br />i just turned down free pizza. Other than that, 16 hours in and so far so good   3:36 PM Oct 29th<br /><br />Is at Denny's. Not eating. Coming here was dumb. 23 hours in.   10:34 PM Oct 29th<br /><br />One third done! Not bad so far. We'll see how the first night on an empty stomach goes.   12:16 AM Oct 30th<br /><br />I am awake. 33 hours in. I feel pretty normal, not as hungry as I was expecting. A little lightheaded, maybe.   8:54 AM Oct 30th <br /><br />Biking is getting increasing more difficult and tiresome. That's the only real symptom so far.   10:04 AM Oct 30th <br /><br />36 hours down. Halfway there. I'm at a constant one out of ten on the hunger scale... Nothing too bad.   12:08 PM Oct 30th<br /><br />Getting very cold. The hunger is amplifying stress from work and I'm definitely getting a bit irritable. Little things are getting to me.   1:52 PM Oct 30th<br /><br />My face is two inches from a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Le sigh.   8:13 PM Oct 30th <br /><br />Going to bed. 49 Hours down, 23 to go. Pocketchange.   1:31 AM Oct 31th<br /><br />48 hours in. I'm feeling no different than normal right now. My sense of smell is definitely heightened though.   8:02 AM Oct 31st<br /><br />Just woke up. Still very three but can't seen to fall back asleep. 56.5 done. I can stubborn the rest of this out.   10:24 AM Oct 31st<br /><br />I wonder if using toothpaste is cheating?   11:35 AM Oct 31st<br /><br />I've seen more free food, drinks, and candy today than ever. Torturrrre. 6 hours left though. Stay the course!   2:05 PM Oct 31st from<br /><br />I have walked part so much free candy today... I an truly being tested. Just bought chicken to grill for tonight.   4:50 PM Oct 31st<br /><br />just finished taekwondo. Less than three hours! I'm going to have broccoli and grapes first, then some nuts, then maybe some chicken.   9:22 PM <br /><br />One hour and sixteen minutes. I'm going to start cooking in about 45 minutes, and then spend about 3 hours savoring a very small meal.   10:43 PM Oct 31st <br /><br />My dinner is ready. Just counting down the minutes...   11:55 PM Oct 31st <br /><br />Victory is sweet. Sweet and tasty.   12:00 AM Nov 1st]]></content:encoded>

I have no intentions to become anorexic or anything like that, but I also find myself eating not when I'm hungry, but when there's food around. I think I just like the feeling of having something to chew, or the taste, without having any actual caloric needs. It's starting to bug me a little, even though I'm vegetarian and pretty healthy. We never really think about our motives for eating, do we?]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Zach I was just checking out rochesterparkour.com (I live in rochester so this is great news) and hopped on over here and I found this very intriguing.<br/><br/>Last year I did a two week juice fast. And the first 72 hours are the hardest! After that it's easy lol Since hunger is purely formed off habit after 3 days you no longer feel hungry and your body starts working on anything besides vital tissue (muscles, organs, etc)  to fuel yourself. It uses toxins, fat, dead cells, etc. And if you stay well hydrated and juice fresh veggies and fruits yourself your body stays fueled and non-stressed from digesting. The side-effect is more energy and vitality!<br/><br/>At that time I had a much higher body fat percentage and would not ever do 2 weeks where I am at now!<br/><br/>Good stuff man.<br/><br/>And also I hope I can make it to the leave no trace event. Too bad it's getting dark at almost 5 pm though! I would really like to start working on PK. So i'll be in touch.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[71 hours, 58 minutes into my 72 hour fast: I sat at the dinner table, my plate of food steaming in front of me. I didn't know how my stomach would take food, so I decided to start with small, easy to digest foods: Olives, raisins, grapes, assorted nuts, steamed broccoli and some salsa for dipping. I had some chicken prepared and ready to go on the grill, but I was going to give that another hour or so. <br /><br />Sitting in my chair, I leaned over and inhaled deeply. When you don't eat for a long period of time, your sense of smell intensifies. I had gone to a grocery store earlier that day, and it was intoxicating. Walking into the store was like walking into a brick wall. I was inundated with smell, I just stopped and stood in the entrance, eyes closed, taking it all in. Charlie did the shopping, and I just ran from display to display, leaning over and inhaling deep. <br /><br />I had two minutes left in my fast, and I spent it with my eyes closed, lost in smell. My phone hit midnight, and I began to eat. I was unsure how my stomach would accept food, so I wanted to take it slow. I ate my dinner nut by nut, raisin by raisin, olive by olive. It took me about an hour to finish my plate, but I enjoyed every bite of food to its fullest. I'd let the grapes sit in my mouth for up to a full minute, absorbing the taste, before biting just enough to let the juice leak out into my mouth. I'd finish cleaving the grape in half, and let the two halves wander around my mouth, saturating my taste buds with flavor. The broccoli dissolved in my mouth, and when ever something was dipped in the salsa my tongue was overwhelmed by the sensation. As I neared the end of my dinner, I grilled a chicken breast. I cleaned my plate of the first course just as the chicken finished, and I probably spent thirty minutes on the single filleted breast of chicken. <br /><br />I learned a lot from my fast, but not all of it I can put into words. A good deal of it was just learning more about my body, becoming closer and more in tune with it. <br /><br />The first and most obvious thing I learned was that I can go three days with only water without radically modifying my daily schedule. I led and participated in a parkour conditioning session, I juggled, I biked to and from campus several times, and I led a Taekwondo class. I got an average amount of sleep each night and only took one nap.<br /><br />The more important thing I learned was how the body reacts to food deprivation. I kind of assumed that the first day would suck, and that it would just keep getting worse. The first day did suck, but the second and third day was actually very easy. I was telling people that it was “disappointingly easy.” After the body realizes it isn't getting food, something happens and you just stop feeling hungry. <br /><br />Rating my hunger on a scale of 1 to 10, this is how I would break down the days: <br /><br />Day 1: <br />Constant hunger (average): 4<br /># of hunger pangs: 15-20<br />Severity of hunger pangs: 7-8<br /><br />Day 2: <br />Constant hunger (average): 2<br /># of hunger pangs: 2-5<br />Severity of hunger pangs: 5<br /><br />Day 3:<br />Constant Hunger (average): 1<br /># of hunger pangs: 0<br />Severity of hunger pangs: N/A<br /><br />So you can see, by the third day my hunger was really just background noise that could be easily turned off. Really, by the second day it was just background noise. The hunger pangs of Day #2 came typically around meal times, which I think was more mental and habit-driven than hunger driven. So really, my 72 hour fast was pretty easy once I got past the first day. <br /><br />Upon later research, I found out that complete fasting isn't the best way to experience hunger. I could have made it a LOT harder for myself if I had waited most of the first day, and then had three almonds for dinner. The second day, had a strawberry for breakfast and then maybe a single bite of chicken for dinner. The third day could have been a half dozen raisins and a peanut for breakfast and then a bite of a banana for lunch. <br /><br />Basically what happens is that in Scenario #1 (what I did), after about 24 hours your body realizes it isn't going to be getting any food (for whatever reason) and it just hunkers down. Your metabolism slows to a crawl and you start turning to fat, muscle, and other sources of stored energy instead of utilizing energy from food currently being digested. In Scenario #2, <a href="http://www.charlesmoreland.com" title="Charles Moreland">Charles</a> explains that your body is constantly being given small amounts of food to digest. This forces it to continuously be switching metabolic pathways from a highly catabolic state to an increase in metabolism to utilize that energy as soon as possible. You end up confusing your body by cutting it short of its energy needs, but still taunting it with some small morsels of food. It is a highly mental side effect though, essentially toying with your desires.<br /><br />I didn't notice many side effects (besides hunger, ha ha). The two primary ones I did notice was temperature and emotional control. In short, I got cold. Really, really, cold. Like, “two pairs of pants, a t-shirt, a zip up hoodie, a sweat shirt, a jacket, and a comforter wrapped around me” cold. Not all the time, and that was definitely the worst time, but I did get cold a lot easier, more often, and more intensely than everyone else around me. It didn't help that during my fast was the first really big cold spell in Rochester. Poor timing, I suppose. The other side effect was a some loss of emotional control. Especially towards the end of the second day and the third day, I started getting a bit short and snarky with people. Some events took place Friday morning that left me pretty depressed, but after a few days of food in my stomach I felt a bit more stable. I don't think I would have taken it so poorly had I been eating. <br /><br />It may have taken me a while to write this post, but I did talk to a few people about the experience once I had finished. My friend Courtney told me about something she did once – she went into the woods, by herself, with only water, a tarp, a sleeping bag, and a candle. She fasted for 48 hours while completely alone. I would like to do some modification of this, perhaps this summer. Get enough water for 5 days and some material to protect me from the elements. Probably some method of starting a fire. I'd go into the woods, alone, far enough where I wouldn't come across anyone, and then just stay there until I felt it was time to come out. The one thing I didn't experience during my fast was focus. I was very distracted by a lot of different things, especially during the third day. Sitting, with absolutely nothing to distract me, for an indeterminate amount of time, sounds like a very different, almost spiritual, experience to me. <br /><br />I'll let you know when I do this. In the mean time, I definitely learned a lot from this experience. Technique is obviously a very important part of parkour training, but I feel like to be a complete and well rounded traceur you should strive to experience as much as you can. I plan on doing a few other types of deprivation training over the next few months, so look out for those posts.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On Saturday, December 6th, <a href="http://www.rochesterparkour.com" title="Rochester Parkour">Rochester Parkour</a> held a “Leave No Trace Initiative/Beginner Parkour Workshop.” Thirty five people put on layer upon layer and headed out into 25 degree weather to Manhattan Square Park in downtown Rochester, New York.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.zaccohn.com/parkour/mLeaveNoTraceGroupShot.jpg" title="Rochester Parkour cleans up Manhattan Square Park"><img src="http://www.zaccohn.com/parkour/sLeaveNoTraceGroupShot.jpg" title="Rochester Parkour cleans up Manhattan Square Park"></a><br /><br />We arrived at 2:00pm with three brooms, three dustpans, two (very) small rakes, six pairs of rubber work gloves, and about four thousand gallons of elbow grease. There were a lot of new faces, people out for the first time, so we all circled up and had a brief introduction to Parkour. Zachary Cohn explained what Parkour is, what it isn't, and what it means to be a traceur. We discussed the different facets of respect – respect for yourself, respect for others, and respect for your environment. Respect for yourself included a discussion on safety and an emphasis on slow progression. Respect for others was about respecting your fellow traceurs, pedestrians, property owners, and law enforcement. Respect for environment was the focus of the discussion however – we talked about how lucky we are to have these amazing locations to train on, and how it is important to give back to the community. We discussed how important it is to pick up trash as you see it; such a small effort can make a huge difference. On Saturday, we decided to clean up Manhattan Square Park.<br /><br />Manhattan Square Park had several years worth of trash, broken glass, cigarettes, leaves, and other miscellaneous junk scattered around it. For the first 90 minutes of the day, we spread out around the park. We raked, swept, and picked up everything we saw. We ended up removing twenty one bags of trash and leaves from the park. It looked AMAZING afterwards, so much better than it did before. And the best part? I found out from a Fire Marshall that was there preparing for a fireworks show that night that there was a parade that evening, and it ended right smack in the middle of the park! So we ended up doing the whole city a huge favor by cleaning up the area for them. It was a very gratifying experience... even if as a whole the city never finds out who cleaned up, we still know and we still can be proud of that.<br /><br />At 3:30, we started the Beginner's Workshop. The group was split about 50/50 between traceurs who had been coming fairly regularly and very inexperienced people. This workshop was focused on the very basics of Parkour, so that's where we started. Jeff Whalley lead the first half of the warm up, and <a href="http://www.charlesmoreland.com" title="Charles Moreland">Charles Moreland</a> wrapped up with quadrupedal movement variants. Once the warmups were finished, Zachary Cohn taught landings in six separate phases: 1) Just jump. 2) Jump and land on the balls of the feet. 3) Jump, land on the balls of the feet, and bend the knees. 4) Jump, land on the balls of the feet, bend the knees, and use your arms when you jump. 5) Jump, land on the balls of the feet, bend knees, and maintain good back posture. 6) Jump, land on the balls of the feet, bend knees, maintain good back posture, and be silent when you land.<br /><br />After everyone was taught how to properly land, we broke up into three separate groups. One group went to a playground with Charles to work on rolls, one group went to the park benches with Jeff to work on vaults, and the third group went with Zac to the field and worked on precisions. We brought three homemade precision trainers use, and then the precision group drilled footwork by taking two steps and then precisioning to a stair. The vault group learned safety vaults, and then some of the more experienced people drilled their speed vaults. The rolling group started by rolling from a squatting position, and some of the more experienced traceurs drilled rolls from standing.<br /><br />We had to rush a little bit at the end, they were going to be shooting off fireworks and we needed to clear out. We packed all of the bags of trash into cars, gave out a few of the new “Rochester Parkour” t-shirts, then went across the street and stretched a bit. We decided to head to a local coffee shop for some well deserved hot chocolate to wrap up the day.<br /><br />All in all, it went off better than we could have possibly expected. The weather was tolerable (and for Rochester, that's as good as it's going to get), we had a HUGE turnout, an <a href="http://www.democratandchronicle.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2008812060321" title="Parkour in Rochester, New York">article in the paper that morning</a>, pulled out 21 bags of trash and leaves from a great training spot, made friends with several parents who were watching their kids play near us, and we all met new people and made new friends.<br /><br />All in all, I'd call it a win.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A month or so ago, Bryan Augstein (Maryland) and KC Parsons (Michigan) told me they wanted to come up to visit me in Rochester. I met both of them on my trip this summer, and (through the wonders of free verizon-to-verizon texts) texted back and forth quite a bit during long bus rides. We became good friends, and so of course I was enthusiastic about having them come up! KC Decided to bring a close friend of his, Nate Manly (Michigan), and soon Jesse Danger (NYPK) and Christopher Price (Michigan) were added to the list of attendees. Soon enough... we were having ourselves a Rochester jam!<br /><br />Jesse arrived at the bus station Thursday night, and we hung out with some friends and watched The Dark Knight on our projector downstairs. We went to sleep late, and then got up early for a workout at the gym. We left straight from there to go back to the bus station KC and Nate arrived early the next morning. After a great (and cheap!) dinner at the local diner, we came back to my house and... immediately dropped to the floor and went to sleep. Jesse and I had 3 hours of sleep and a workout, and KC and Nate had a 14 hour bus ride under their belt. We woke up 5 hours later and went to the Red Barn, the local rock climbing gym (it's a big red barn. Go figure!). Chris showed up, and we all packed in his pickup truck and went to the bus station to pick up Bryan. <br /><br />Everyone was hungry again, so it was time for dinner. If it's your first time in Rochester, there is only one meal your hosts will give you: a garbage plate:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.zaccohn.com/parkour/garbage_plate.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;" src="http://www.zaccohn.com/parkour/garbage_plate.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />Ingredients: hash browns, chili sauce, macaroni salad, 2 hamburger patties, American cheese, diced raw onions, mustard, ketchup.<br /><br />So... I sort of kind of challenged Jesse to an eating contest, to see who could finish theirs faster. We decided on to have a good, old fashioned gentlemen's wager: The loser had to eat a second one. Long story short, I didn't lose. I got annihilated. Destroyed. Pummeled into the ground. I still hold that it would have been at least a fair fight if it hadn't been for the mayo on the mac salad.. but alas. I ended up chickening out of the bet, but I accepted an alternate punishment: The Hundred Burpee Challenge. Outside. In the snow and wind and cold. <br /><br />I have to say, I did fairly well. I've never actually done the Hundred Burpee Challenge before, and a time of 9:16 isn't shabby (all things considered). I did it without vomiting, which was A) A nice perk, and B) means I didn't try hard enough. This event gave rise to a series of challenges throughout the weekend, with a complex series of governing rules (such as the hundred burpee challenge is an acceptable alternative punishment for losing, but if you don't “one up” the previous challenge in some way (ex. Faster time, fewer clothes, etc), you had to do the original punishment as well). <br /><br />We got back to my house that night, and things kind of slowed down. We spent the next few hours laying around my living room, half-trying to find something to do, but really just trying to recover from the garbage plates. Then someone saw the slacklines on the staircase, and we had an idea. <br /><br />We hopped in cars, drove to a nearby abandoned Kodak building with a huge secluded parking lot, and played in the snow for a while. We ran and slid and played tag, explored some woods, and had some epic snowball fights.<br /><br />Saturday was Parkour day! We woke up, Happydud's Emporium of Pancakes was once again visited, and then started piling on the layers. We drove up to campus to pick up the locals, and then drove over to Manhattan Square Park in downtown Rochester. After a good warm up (because it certainly was not warm out), we decided it was just too slippery and dangerous for Parkour training. Instead, we had a series of truly legendary snowball fights. We started in a field, then had a Capture the Flag match in another area that was a great mix of nature and urban environments, all the while snowballs flying everywhere. We wrapped up the day with a game of Humans vs Zombies – Snowball Style, then stopped by a coffee shop and a mexican resteraunt for dinner. <br /><br />After warming back up at my house, we went to a playground for the night. While everyone else was either doing random strength training stuff (rings, muscle ups, finding routes through the playground), or having 2v1 wrestling matches (I still say it was a draw... if I can go that long without tapping out it has to count for something!), Jesse was busy constructing a sled out of two skis and a precision trainer he found in the back of my car. <br /><br />Well, that was an awesome freaking sled. We went SO FAST. Graham, a local traceur and EMT (foreshadowing!), had brought a bunch of real sleds. We all took turns on the various sleds and picnic table (which, it turns out, makes a fantastic sled as long as you bail fast enough), until Chris went snowboarding on one of the sleds. Turns out, Grade 2 ankle sprains are the reason you use sleds as intended, and not as snowboards. Graham was able to wrap him up and make sure he was okay, but it was still a bummer. <br /><br />The next day was gymnastics day! I went to our gym, <a href="http://www.zenith-gym.com" title="Zenith Gymnastics">Zenith Gymnastics</a>, and taught my kids Parkour class, and then the visitors joined the RIT Gymnastics club in a gymnastics training session. It was loads of fun, people worked on everything from back tucks to side summis over things, from rings to jumping over things. It was a pretty productive session, and everyone had a lot of fun finally getting to run and jump and flip and horse around. We wrapped up the day with pizza and movies, and then I started shuttling people back to the bus station.<br /><br />That wraps up the <a href="http://www.rochesterparkour.com" title="Rochester Parkour">Rochester Parkour</a> Visitor's Weekend. Not much actual Parkour, but still great fun was had by all. I'm glad we could give Nate a great first jam-weekend, and it was great seeing all my old friends again. We're already planning our next few gatherings!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>This Is How I Play: Introduction</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This post is an introduction to a blog series I will be publishing over the next month called “This Is How I Play.” The inspiration for this comes from a book I'm reading, Exuberant Animal, by Frank Forencich. In one of his articles he claims that we “study and test, research and measure, drilling our knowledge down to the deepest levels, and then we wonder why people find exercise so dull and unattractive. We strip human movement down to the sterile elements of anatomy, physiology, and biomechanics and then complain that no one wants to participate.”

I don't agree with this quote 100%, especially for high level athletes, but I think that a lot of fitness programs (especially for school-aged children) should pay a lot of attention. If games were emphasized as the primary method of physical activity, it will not only be more effective but also will be a lot more enjoyable. And that's really the secret to a successful fitness program. If exercise can be made fun, then people will WANT to come back and participate again; they will enjoy and look forward to it.

I'm not talking about sports however – there's a huge difference between sports and games. Sports are fantastic – for athletes. But if you aren't an athlete, you probably aren't going to have many opportunities to play sport-games. Even when you do play a pickup game, there is often equipment, a large number of people, or a specific location necessary for that sport. In order for the game to be played all of these conditions must be met, and that is often very difficult to plan and organize. Then there's the potentially humiliating experience of picking teams and, once the game starts, not being passed to or truly included.

The kind of games I'm talking about are more free-form and creative. Things that really engage the imagination, and don't necessarily have a lot of rules. During this series, I'm going to be giving examples of a lot of different games. Some are games developed by the parkour community, some are games I've developed, and others are just random games that I've come across in my travels. For most of the games, I have also listed one or two variants or combinations, a way to develop a whole new game simply by changing the rules or mixing it with another game.

Creativity and imagination is fundamental to what makes us human, but many kids aren't given the opportunities to exercise their brains and their body together. Encourage your kids to create their own games to play, or you can use these games, or make up your own variations of these games to play! Most of these games can be played without any equipment and can be played by anyone, five to fifty five, skinny or heavy, male or female.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>This Is How I Play #2 - PDQ</title>
		<link>http://www.zaccohn.com/2009/01/this-is-how-i-play-2-pdq/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Game: The first game is called PDQ, or Pretty Darn Quick. This is an incredibly popular parkour game, where the basic objective is to jump on peoples' feet. This is actually one of the more complicated games, it usually takes a practice game for everyone to get the hang of it. I often play a “demo game” as I'm teaching it, so people can see the rules and their effects.

<img title="PDQ: Pretty Darn Quick" src="http://www.longacrefarms.com/SupportingFiles/Images/aboutus_jumping_large.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />

Rules: You start in a circle and everyone puts one first in the center. Someone (usually the winner of the last game) picks a random person, taps their fist, and counts “one,” moves to the next person in the circle, “two” and so on until everyone has been numbered. Once everyone has a number, everyone shouts “One, two, three, PDQ!” and everyone simultaneously takes one jump away from the center.

At this point, you continue in number order (“one” is first, “two” is second, etc). When it is your turn to go, your goal is to jump on someone else's foot. No one can move until you are in the air, however. If you feint and pretend to jump and someone else moves their feet, then they are eliminated. If you jump and land on someone's feet, they are eliminated.

The interesting twist to this game is... you can only jump when the person who is “it” is in the air. However, if you jump and land on someone else's feet, you can still get them out even though it isn't your turn.

Goal: The game continues until only one person remains.

Example Game: John, Sue, Peggy, and Roger are playing PDQ. John is player #1, Sue is player #2, Peggy is player #3, and Roger is player #4.

Round #1: John jumps into the air and lands on Roger's left foot. Roger is out. Sue and Peggy both jump away from John.

Round #2: Sue jumps towards John, but John jumps towards Peggy and lands on her feet. Peggy is out.

Round #3: John feints, but Sue doesn't fall for it. John then jumps, but Sue jumps straight up and lands on John's feet. John is out. Sue wins the game.

Physical Benefits: This game is nothing more than jumping, but it turns it into a very enjoyable and competitive game. It's not highly physically demanding, but it is a great method of training for jumping, as well as precision landings.

Other Benefits: This is quite a fun game because it is actually a bit taboo. We've always been told not to step on people's feet... but now we're supposed to! If you present it to kids this way, they can get really excited about it. This is also a very flexible game; it can be scaled to any number of people. I've played with only my sister, and then I've played a game with 45 other people. The more people there are the  more hectic it gets, with people jumping at you from all directions.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>This Is How I Play #3 - QM Tag</title>
		<link>http://www.zaccohn.com/2009/01/this-is-how-i-play-3-qm-tag/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Game: This next game is called QM (Quadrupedal Movement) Tag. It's a popular variation on regular tag, except you have to stay on all fours the entire time. These game is a lot of fun, but also is quite the workout as it encourages some mad scrambles to get away.

Rules: The rules are pretty simple. Usually I designate a specific area the players must stay in. This keeps the game fast and intense, and prevents people from spreading out too far. In order to tag someone, you must tag their elbows. This makes it a bit more difficult to tag other players.
Goal: For the player who is “it” to tag another player's elbow.

Physical Benefits: For anyone who hasn't tried it, QM is a fantastic full body exercise. Essentially, walk around on your hands and feet with your hips and shoulders low to the ground – the lower the harder! Once you've walked around like this for a while, try doing it backwards. And then do it up and down stairs, or all around the house. Once you're comfortable with walking around like this, try to balance (not while playing tag though!) and walk on a railing or on top of a fence on all fours.

<img title="QM Balancing" src="http://www.zaccohn.com/parkour/phillycatwalk.jpg" alt="QM Balancing" width="302" height="201" />

Other benefits: In addition to making you stronger, compound, full body movements like this teach your brain how to use muscles together, instead of just individually. Whenever you learn a new movement, whether it's QM, juggling, or playing piano, you are actually constructing new neural pathways in your brain. People, especially children, who stimulate their brains in new ways will continue to develop more neural pathways. These people tend to have more active, creative, and powerful brains. By learning how to move in new and creative ways, you can actually get smarter!

Another added plus, it's a pretty effective method of wearing your kids out.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>This Is How I Play #4 –PDQM</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Game: Today’s game was invented during one of the Philly jams. It is called PDQM. It doesn’t really stand for anything, just a combination of “Pretty Darn Quick” and “Quadrupedal Motion.” This game is a combination of PDQ and QM Tag.

Rules: All players must start the game on all fours. Any body configuration is acceptable, as long as all four limbs are touching the ground. The game begins like PDQ: each player counts off.  No player may move until the player whose turn it is jumps into the air. The twist to this game is that the players must be on all fours. In order to tag someone out, you must tag someone’s hand with your hand, or their foot with your foot.  When the player who is “it” is leaping, all other players may move to avoid or to tag someone else out.

Goal: To be the last player untagged.

Variation: Limb elimination. This is actually a pretty standard variant that we play by. If your left hand gets tagged, then you lose that hand, but you are still in the game. You only get “out” when you can no longer support yourself and a non-limb part of your body touches the ground (chest, butt, head, etc). If you lose two feet and a hand, you better hope you can balance on one hand.

Physical Benefits: This game combines the physical benefits of PDQ with QM tag. With the limb elimination modification, it force you to be able to balance in strange positions as well as move from strange positions with unusual restrictions. This game can tire you out more quickly than PDQ or QM tag, and it also is a lot of fun.

Other benefits: This game is an example of the creativity that can be applied to parkour and games. We had two games, and after some modifications to the rules, came up with an entirely new game. Creating games doesn’t have to be hard.

Homework: I want everyone to do this as a creativity exercise. Pick two games. Review the rules in your head quickly, and then figure out a way to combine them. The new game doesn’t have to work well, or be fun, and you don’t even have to play it! Just synthesize a set of rules for a new game from two pre-existing games. <strong>I want everyone who reads this to do this exercise three times, and then post the best game you come up with in the comments of this article.</strong> Your brain is just like a big muscle. The more you work it, the stronger it gets. The more you use your creativity, the more creative you get. So start exercising your creativity, and let me see what you come up with.]]></content:encoded>

The person who is "It" may tag only by grabbing another player's hand, wrist, or forearm. The attached person is not also "It" and may interfere with tagging. Anyone tagged past the first one goes to the end of the line.<br/><br/>Goal: to be the last person untagged.<br/><br/>Variation: the entire line is "It."

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I should be given Jon Payne's ticket to IM Spring Break. I am a student studying Marketing in Rochester, New York, and I want to focus in Internet Marketing for my career.  I have pending employment with an Internet Marketing firm in Baltimore for this summer, and unlike most students who complete their schooling and then start implementing what they've learned, I am already working with American Parkour (www.americanparkour.com) to improve their Internet Marketing strategies. I can take advantage of what I learn at this conference IMMEDIATELY, whereas other students who attend would wait until after graduation to begin to use what they've gained. By that time it might already be too late. This field is changing so rapidly that implementing a strategy developed a year or two prior is likely to result in an epic belly flop.

Not only can I take excellent advantage of this contest, but I'm almost as cool as you are Jon, so I would be an adequate replacement to send in your sted.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Rochester Parkour hosted their first “Beginner's Parkour Workshop” in December. 35 people attended, mostly regulars. On Saturday, March 28th, Rochester Parkour hosted their second “Beginner's Parkour Workshop.” There was no definitive count, but the lower estimate was 100 people, mostly newcomers. During the first workshop, it was in the low 30s and starting to snow. This time, it was in the high 60s, sunny, and a beautiful day.

<img title="Rochester Parkour Beginner Workshop" src="http://clicksbym.com/parkour/content/bin/images/large/2009_03_28_parkour_382.jpg" alt="Rochester Parkour Beginner Parkour Workshop" width="400" />
This picture was taken at the end of the workshop, after approximately half the group had left.

The workshop was scheduled to start at 2:30, but Zac decided to go a little bit early. When he got there at 2:00, there was already a handful of people waiting. After some introductions and idle chit-chat, Zac noticed a police car pulling up and parking nearby. After watching for a bit, the officers got out of their car and started walking over. At this point, Zac was convinced that the workshop was going to get broken up 25 minutes before it even started! He started walking toward the officers to introduce himself. After a brief exchange of introductions, the officers asked if this was the Parkour thing they saw on the RNews (the local news station). Reluctantly, Zac replied that it was. At this point, everyone else was silent and staring. There was a ten second awkward silence, then one officer laughed and said “You guys aren't in trouble! We just thought it was cool and wanted to check it out. We're not even from around here, we're from the next district over.”

Everyone talked with the officers for a bit, and they even said they'd try to stop back again during the workshop (although they weren't able to). It was a stressful, but overall positive indication of how the day was going to go!

Over the course of the next 25 minutes, more and more people showed up. Introductions were made, a Frisbee game broke out. A lot of teenage boys were coming, but there was also at least 10 girls who came out to participate! There were some adults, and even a few families that came out to give it a try! There was a husband and a wife, and their three young children who did a fantastic job! People just kept pouring over the hill and onto the field, until it was about 2:40, and it was definitely time to get started. A quick estimate of the turnout resulted in over 100 people!

Zac led everyone to the field, and we started off with a brief discussion. Zac explained what was, and what wasn't, parkour, and what was going to be covered in the workshop. Then random people in the audience were asked “Why are you here today? Why did you come to this workshop?” Everyone gave a different answer, ranging from “It's better than sitting inside” to “I've watched a lot of videos, and I wanted to learn how to do that, but safely.” After the Q&amp;A session... it was time to get started!

With 100+ people, the warm up was interesting. We ended up doing two laps around the field, alternating between running forwards, backwards, and side to side – all while trying really hard not to trample anyone. Everyone then lined up and was taught basic QM, forwards and backwards. Seeing 100 people on their hands and feet crawling across a field is quite the sight! Landings were next, and Zac used his step-by-step progression to teach everyone the basics fairly quickly.

From here, the best way to deal with 100 people is to make them... not 100 people. So Charles Moreland took 1/3rd of the group to practice precisions, local traceur Zachary Leo took another 1/3rd to work on rolling and QM, and Zac Cohn took the last 1/3rd to learn basic vaults. The vaulting group started with the safety vault. After most people were comfortable with that, those who were ready learned reverse safety vaults. This was a bit different, but it ended up working really well. Benches were being used to vault over, so it was very easy to progress safely. The vault section ended with the Speed vault for those who were comfortable with the Safety vault, and that pretty much took up the rest of the time until the groups rotated.

After everyone hit every station, it was “free time.” People were free to work on whatever they felt they were weak in, or whatever was the most fun! Zac led a wallrun workshop, while his roommate Artem Sivak worked with people on climbups. This was a wildly successful station, with almost half the group coming over to learn.

After the free time was over, it was time for a game of Follow the Leader. Charles Moreland took the advanced/experienced group, while Zac led the beginners. QM, vaults, precisions, and some climbing were all utilized to give people a good workout, and to teach them about exploring their environment in new and interesting ways. Both games of Follow the Leader ended on the field, where everyone stretched out and chatted with their new friends.

All in all, there was beautiful weather, a huge and diverse turn out, and everyone had a ton of fun. There were many photographer's there, and a news crew from the RIT ESPN Sports Zone.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I think to truly understand the phrase "Be strong to be useful," you can simply modify it to: "Be useful."

On Saturday, Charles Moreland and I were driving back from the grocery store. We were already 20 minutes late to our own party, it was raining, cold, and there were 30mph gusts. While at a stop light, Charles noticed a van in the intersection across from us. It was stopped in the left turn lane, cars were going around it, and all the lights were off. The lights came back on, briefly, and then went out again. Clearly, their car was dead.

Immediately, and pretty much without speaking, it was agreed that we'd pull into the nearest parking lot, don our jackets and gloves, and run into the middle of the road to help. We walked up to the car, and I waved. The old russian man cracked the door open suspiciously, as I announced that we were here to help. "I already called Triple A" he said. "They'll be here within the hour." I waved my hand toward the oncoming cars. "It's not safe for you to be in this intersection. Throw the car in neutral and we're going to push you into the parking lot."

I think there was a bit of a language barrier, and a bit of suspicion about these random boys who showed up out of no where to help, but once we got behind the car and started to push, he shifted into neutral and steered. Once we got out of the intersection, we pushed the car (uphill! Damn minivans are heavy.) through the road and into a parking space. I noticed about halfway through, whenever he could, the old man opened the door and tried to help push with his foot.

We got to the parking space, he put it in park, and he and his wife got out of the car and thanked us profusely. She asked us if we were in school, and if we were done with calculus yet (she is a calculus tutor at a local high school apparently), and she gave us her card. The man shook our hands and thanked us many times. I gave them my card and told them to call me if they needed any more help - I lived just five minutes away.

Getting out of my car to help two complete strangers in need? To me, this is more parkour than the biggest prevision, the furthest kong to cat, or the largest drop.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Summertime Challenge</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[While Parkour takes up a large part of my life, I also study Marketing and Business, with a focus in technology. I spent a better part of the Winter and Spring looking for summer employment, hopefully doing some sort of Internet Marketing. Due to the economy, however, it's unlikely I'm going to be employed this summer. I'll be out making contacts in the community, but there will be a lot more free time than I anticipated.

At school, we don't watch television. My roommate is actually going to sell his TV, it's been so long since we last used it. But in the summer I'm not around as many people, and often I'll turn the TV on as background noise while making breakfast or something. Often I'll get sucked into whatever I'm watching and end up wasting half the day. I always feel like crap after, but it's just what happens.

So now I'm in a quandary. I'm going to have a lot of free time, but I don't want it to get sucked up by TV. So I've come up with a summer challenge for myself, and I invite all of you to partake as well:

The challenge is essentially "No TV during daylight." No movies, no video games, nothing. Computer use is restricted to email and business uses. Instead, I propose everyone create a list - a long list - of things to do.

This list should comprise of skills to learn, books to read, places to go, and things to do. Mark each one in a category, and then write the skill. Don't limit yourself to Parkour oriented skills - use this summer to make yourself a more rounded person.

An exerpt from my list:

Gymnastics: Consistent 10 second handstand
Gymnastics: Front Lever Progression - Advanced Tuck
Tricking: B-twist
Tricking: Flashkicks
Marketing: Read at least two SEO books
Marketing: Attend at least 3 networking events a month
Juggling (balls): Factory on both sides
Juggling (clubs): Cuts with clubs
Juggling (poi): Five beat weave
Circus: Learn to ride Unicycle
Slacklining: Vertical jump
Slacklining: Horizontal jump at least two feet.
Reading: Read 5 fiction books
Reading: Read 5 non-fiction books.
Anatomy: Learn names of major muscles in the body, how to ID them.
Martial Arts: Find local Kali group and learn basics of Kali.
Martial Arts: Track down Taekwondo instructor, train with him.
Cars: Learn how to change my oil
Cars: Teach sister to parallel park.

Again, this is just an exerpt from my list. I want everyone to make their own list for the summer, print it out, and put it on their refridgerator. When you complete an item, physically cross it off.

Your list doesn't have to be realistic for the time constraints. I doubt I'll get all of this, let alone my entire list, complete in twelve weeks. But at least every day, I'll be able to wake up and know that I have a lot of things I can do instead of watching television.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Call for Help - Parkour Non-Profit Fundraiser</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Some of my closest Parkour friends are from Seattle, Washington. Of the people there, Tyson Cecka has started a non-profit organization called "Parkour Visions."

"<a title="Parkour Visions" href="http://www.parkourvisions.org/">Parkour Visions</a> seeks to improve the health and well-being of today's movement-starved and overworked population by revealing the world filled with rewarding mental and physical challenges that everyone can playfully use to improve themselves.

We are a nonprofit organization bringing the exciting new sport of parkour / freerunning into mainstream society in a safe and responsible way through our classes, outreach programs, educational resources, and partnerships.

We believe that fitness should not only be physically demanding, but should challenge us intellectually, put us in touch with our environment, and expand our understanding of ourselves. Through parkour we hope to help children and adults connect with their innate love of movement, get in touch with their surroundings, and experience the full potential of what their bodies have evolved to do."

They're currently fundraising to finance their outreach programs for at-risk children. If they make their goal of $4,000 by the end of June, it will earn them a permanent spot on the GlobalGiving.org, which will help fund their programs for a long time!

The description of the project:

"Here's the deal: I'm betting all of you have had problems before getting parkour recognized as a legitimate useful activity that's not just kids jumping off of buildings and goofing around ;) We're all in this challenge together to be recognized as a worthwhile discipline to the masses and that's why places like these forums and projects like Jump Westminster and Leave No Trace have extra importance.

In Seattle, Washington they've started up a whole not-for-profit organization to help address this and guide parkour into the mainstream. Their largest project yet is launching this month which involves teaching low-income and homeless young people parkour through a public school, four apartment complexes, and a teen crisis center (so far).

They have little money to back this up and are reaching out to the worldwide parkour community to give as much as $10 to the cause. If they can raise $4,000 by the end of this month they can reach the tipping point and fund these programs till the end of the year. That's only one corporate sponsor and a few hundred individual donors. The media coverage and lasting impacts of these programs could be huge and be a big boon for parkour in the US and globally.

<a href="http://www.globalgiving.com/projects/parkour-for-at-risk-disadvantaged-youth/">Take a look and please help by donating $10 or at least spreading this around.</a>"

Please help out Parkour Visions - even a donation of $10 will go a long way to supporting the first Parkour non-profit in America!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Keeping Busy This Summer</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We're now officially halfway through Summer, and I've been keeping busy. I've started, finished, and am working on quite a few different projects.

<strong>1. APK Affiliate Program</strong>
Toward the beginning of the summer, I came up with an idea to connect American Parkour more with other websites and communities. This eventually developed into the <a title="APK Affiliate Program" href="http://www.americanparkour.com/content/view/4186/437/">APK Affiliate Program.</a> I've been leading the charge on this, and Im really happy with where this is going. At the time of this posting, we have four published Affiliates, two more waiting to be published, about 6 more in the works, and I'm getting more and more emails about it every day.

I think this is a great way for APK to boost the visibility of a lot of smaller, local sites and drive a lot more traffic to them. It's also a great way to get the people from those sites connected with, using, and contributing to APK and its resources, which will make APK a better community for everyone.

<strong>2. Marketing APK and Primal</strong>
I've always been very vocal about my ideas for APK (and I've had plenty), but this summer I was hired on as the official Marketing Manager for APK and Primal Fitness DC and Miami. I've been putting together plans and projects to help get the word about APK out there to new people, and to help grow awareness of <a title="Primal Fitness" href="http://www.primal-fitness.com">Primal Fitness DC</a> and help get <a title="Primal Fitness Miami" href="http://miamifreerunning.com/index.php/classes/class-schedule/calendars/1">Primal Fitness Miami</a> started on the right track. This is an exciting opportunity for me to work even harder to grow and guide the organizations that have helped me so much.

<strong>3. Content Manager for APK</strong>
For almost a year now, I've been in charge of updating the front page of American Parkour on a daily basis. There is the occasional slow day, but for the most part there is something to post every single day. I have a couple different methods of gathering information: I use a series of Google Alerts to track breaking and developing stories. I check the forums for interesting videos, posts, articles, and information. People email me if they think they have something newsworthy.

I email everything to myself, then use a special Gmail label I set up to label it as a front page item. After I post it, I archive it. This system enables me to search my gmail for the string "label:frontpage in:inbox" and it will display all the stories I have yet to publish.

The role of content manager helps me really keep track of what's going on at a local, national, and international level and stay connected with people all over the world. These connections have enabled me to do a much better job with some of my other projects, like the APK Affiliate program.

<strong>4. Nunchucks</strong>
This is a bit of a side project. I decided I wanted to make a set of nunchucks, but really go all-out on them. I looked up a local woodworking club and went to one of their meetings. I sat and talked with some of the members for a few hours to learn more about basic woodworking. I went to Home Depot and grabbed a utility knife, then I went to a place in Annapolis called Exotic Woods. I was looking through their scrap pile and found 3 pieces of walnut wood. I cut one in half, and ended up with four rectangular pieces of wood.

<img title="Homemade nunchucks" src="http://www.zaccohn.com/pics/t_nunchucks.jpg" alt="Homemade nunchucks" />
The left pair have been sanded, the right pair gets sanded today.

I spent about 10 hours whittling (probably a good 4 hours for the first one, 3 for the second, 2 for the third and 1 for the fourth. I was getting better and better!) them into cylinders. I've spent about an hour sanding and that step is half done. Next, I'm going to use a tool my friend lent me. It's kind of like a soldering iron, but it's for burning designs/lettering into wood. I'm going to engrave four quotes, one on each chuck. I've decided on two of the quotes:

"Power Is Nothing Without Control"
"Etre fort pour être utile." (Translation: Be Strong to be Useful)

I haven't decided on the other two. Leave suggestions in the comments!

After I etch the quotes in, I'll stain it and then attach the chain. And then I'll have some awesome homemade nunchucks, and will have learned more about whittling, etching, and staining.

<strong>5. Local Parkour Training</strong>
Some locals and I have set up regular, twice a week sessions in the Severna Park, Maryland area. I have a lot of friends who were interested in training, but didn't really want to go off and figure it out on their own. When I came back from college we set these up, and we've had a good number of beginners show up (and stay!). I've done a ton of teaching in Rochester, but this group is a mix of experienced and inexperienced people, so finding a good balancing point of activities has been an interesting task.

I trained with the Bar-Barians a bit in NYC a few weeks ago, and it's solidified my opinion that strength and conditioning is paramount not only for safety, but will also in learning new techniques. See video below to learn about the Bar-Barians.

<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="560" height="340" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/r3DHd9yV2pM&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="560" height="340" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/r3DHd9yV2pM&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>

We were doing parkour with one of them, and he moved like he'd been training for three years. Turns out, this was his third parkour session. His incredible amount of strength made learning new techniques a piece of cake. Because of this, we've been doing mostly conditioning at our training sessions. I'm subscribing to the belief that if you focus almost solely on strength and conditioning for the first months of your training, you will progress much faster later on.

Those are some of the projects I've been working on this summer. While it was definitely frustrating not being hired this summer because I wasn't willing to work for free, I've definitely been keeping busy and staying productive.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am by no means spoiled. But sometimes it is necessary and proper to throw yourself on the ground, scream, flail, and thrash around for a bit. This is pretty much how I ensured that the basements of my townhouse complex remain unlocked...

I live in an on-campus townhouse complex called Colony (which falls somewhere between "the slums" and "low-income housing" on my scale of RIT Housing). Despite the distance from campus, disrepair, and the smelly, ant-and-bee-infested swamp I have for a backyard, I really enjoy living there. One of the major draws is the basement - the only RIT housing option with a basement. We have two rooms, a "family room" and a "utility room."

According to the <a title="RIT Housing" href="http://finweb.rit.edu/housing/apartments/colonymanor.html#2townhouse">RIT Housing website</a>, the Family Room is 12 x 21, and the Utility Room is 13 x 21. There is a very thin, poorly constructed wall (with holes in it) between the two rooms, and a door connecting them.

I was back home in Maryland this summer, but my roommate <a title="Charles Moreland" href="http://www.charlesmoreland.com">Charles Moreland</a> stayed in our townhouse. One day, he emailed me and was furious that "Housing was locking our basement."

...What? I didn't get this email. I had him forward me the email, which stated that "this necessary work is being done to address past occurrences with fire code violations and maintenance issues. These incidents include: inappropriate storage of combustible materials near the furnace and hot water tank, and the sump pump being clogged with debris (resulting in flooded basements)."

I assumed my email was waiting in a queue somewhere, and was bound to arrive sometime that night. Over 24 hours passed, and I still hadn't received an email. That's when I realized that Housing was trying to pull a fast one on any residents not actively living there over the summer.

And that's when I got angry. And to quote the Hulk, you wouldn't like me when I'm angry.

I thought for a moment, then came up with a plan.

<strong>Phase I) Write an email.</strong> I wrote an email that started off by thanking them for locking our basement. I told them that I was glad that they were going to lock off 273 square feet of our townhouse, but I was confused as to why they didn't mention the $704 I would save in rent that year! I continued this implication that they were lowering our rent for a while, and told them I planned on using the money to buy food and textbooks - things I wasn't able to afford both of last year.

I acknowledged I was being sarcastic, and then I pointed out that this yet one more problem in a long line of "miscommunication issues" that Housing was facing. I was part of a Housing Committee that Housing disbanded (because these were the kind of issues we were bringing up. You know, <em>real ones.</em>). I pointed out that they weren't updating their Housing Guidelines handbook, they weren't informing students of changes to policies (or weren't until it was too late), and that they inconsistently enforced other policies. It was also unacceptable that they kept this a secret from most of the people it would effect (school-year residents). I offered my contact information for further discussion, and I promised they would hear more complaints.

And then I sent it 15 people. Everyone from the Director of Housing to the President and Vice-President of Student Government to the Director of Student Affairs. One person could ignore it... but fifteen couldn't.

I got an email from the President of Student Government telling me he was "looking into the situation," and then I got a call from one of the higher-ups in Housing. We spoke on the phone for some time, and he insisted that this was the way it was, and there was nothing I could do.

So then I got serious.

<strong>Phase II - Spark a Social Wildfire.</strong> I knew they could ignore me and my opinions, so I needed to get the word out. Which, I believe, is why Facebook was invented. I wrote a Facebook note that briefly informed people what was happening, why it was happening, and what I was doing to stop it. Then I picked one of the people from my email list, and I told everyone to email that person one person and complain. I was trying to ensure that the complaints would be concentrated. I posted an alarmist status update ("Do you live in Colony? Housing is trying to lock your basement! Read my note to learn how to stop it!"), and then asked people to repost my status update and my note.

I also contacted several social activists on campus and we were beginning to plan a Walk on the Housing office.

It spread quickly, and while I have no idea how many emails my target received, it must have been enough. All Colony residents (ALL residents, summer and school-year) received an email a few days later that "after phone conversations with several students residing in the Colony Manor townhomes as well as reviewing feedback posted on Facebook and through email, I’ve decided on a compromise."

<strong>Phase III- Resolution.</strong> They came in and marked off an area around the furnace where we couldn't store anything, and they put a grate over the sump pump. This was a perfectly legitimate, appropriate, and valid response to the problem, whereas locking the entire room was punative and disproportionate to the problem.

So while some people get an email like that, say "Damn, that sucks" and shrug it off, other people get up and complain. When that doesn't work, but your cause is just and right, then it's time to throw yourself on the floor, scream, flail, and thrash wildly until you get your way.]]></content:encoded>

<strong><a title="I Fought Housing and I won" href="http://www.zaccohn.com/2009/09/i-fought-housing-and-i-won">5. Challenged Housing Department to get our basements back:</a></strong>

Housing is more or less constantly trying to pull a fast one on RIT students. They often get away with it, but sometimes they just take things too far. Here's the story of how Housing tried to lock the basements of all the townhouses in my complex, and how I started a movement and stopped them by using social networking and a the power of rallying people behind a cause!

[caption id="" align="alignright" width="200" caption="No Food for 72 Hours"]<img style="margin: 10px;" title="No Food for 72 Hours" src="http://capremix.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/healthy_diet1.jpg" alt="No Food For Me!" width="200" height="157" />[/caption]
<strong><a title="72 Hour Fast" href="http://www.zaccohn.com/2008/10/72-hour-fast">4. 72 Hour Fast:</a></strong>

I grew up in an upper-middle class family with a fully stocked refrigerator. Sometimes we were out of peanut butter, but we were never out of food. So I decided to find out what it was like to go three days without eating. I did not alter my schedule at all, and I used Twitter to keep a constant log of how I was feeling.

<strong><a title="Zac's Trip Across the Country" href="http://www.americanparkour.com/learn/154-wheres-zac?layout=default">3. Trip around the country:</a></strong>

I was faced with a choice. Should I look for a summer job, or should I blow a fair deal of my money and travel to 20 different cities across the country meeting new people, seeing new places, and training Parkour? No real contest. I took planes, trains, and busses and never spent a dime on housing by staying with parkour friends. Read the stories (be sure not to miss the Plane to San Francisco one), see the pictures, and watch the videos of my 8 week trip.

<strong><a title="Rochester Parkour" href="http://www.rochesterparkour.com/">2. Rochester Parkour:</a></strong>

When I came to RIT as a freshmen, there were only two other people training in all of Rochester, and they were about 45 minutes away. Since I founded Rochester Parkour one year ago, we've had special Beginner Workshops with over 100 attendees, host training sessions with over 40 regulars, have had two television interviews and five newspaper articles, been featured by the Rochester Area Community Foundation nonprofit organization, negotiated to teach children's classes out of a gymnastics gym, and led free children's workshops for the Strong National Museum of Play.

<strong><a title="Backflips!" href="http://dudflip.ytmnd.com/">1. Backflips!:</a></strong>

And undoubtedly the coolest thing I've done... Backflips! What most people don't know about backflips is that they're also semi-legal tender in some places. I've done backflips for raffle tickets, backflips for cheese, and backflips for cash!</ol>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Decentralizing Parkour Jam Planning using Twitter</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the major problems with parkour communities right now is jam planning and coordination. Currently, Rochester uses Facebook to plan jams. Honestly I wish it hadn't turned out that way. The only way to announce your jam was to post on the discussion boards (which no one checks with any real frequency in ANY Facebook group) or to send out a message. Only administrators of the group can send out messages though, so unless I made everyone an administrator, only a few select people could effectively plan jams.

I recognized how detrimental this was to the community and I made a push to start using the American Parkour forums.  As it stands, almost all typical parkour communities use forums to plan their jams, and it works pretty well. Forums allow anyone to post a jam, they facilitate easy discussion and planning of the jam, and it leaves a public record of past events. The problem is people had no incentive to check APK because any event we planned was blasted to them through Facebook. Additionally, it's difficult to reach critical mass on a forum (as defined by the amount of activity occurring to keep it interesting enough for people to keep coming back and generating more activity). So short of the leaders of the community abandoning Facebook entirely. I had to find a way to solve this problem in order for the community to be sustainable. How could we decentralize jam planning without destroying the community?

<img style="float: left; margin: 10px;" src="http://a0.twimg.com/a/1256597179/images/twitter_logo_header.png" alt="Twitter" />Then the idea. Twitter. It all fell into place, and the solution is SO much cooler than you think it is.

A quick rundown on Twitter lingo in case you aren't familiar. A Twitter update is called a tweet. You can do something called "retweeting" which is basically quoting someone. It's typically used as a way of saying "hey. This guy is pretty cool, you (your followers) should hear what he has to say." Then there are hashtags, which is Twitters keyword system. You can end a tweet with #08DebateTopics, and then whenever someone who was interested in 2008 election debate topics searched for that hashtag, tweets about energy policy, Iraq, and the economy would all come up.

So here is how my solution works:
<ul>
	<li>Step 1: start a hashtag, #parkourjam. If I want to go train, I write a tweet like "Tuesday. Five PM. In front of the library. #parkourjam"</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Step 2: Run a Twitter search for the hashtag, and then save the RSS feed for that search.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Step 3: write a perl script to scrape that RSS feed and republish it. (this is necessary because Twitter uses nofollow links, which will screw up the next step.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Step 4: run your new RSS feed through Yahoo Pipes. Apply some clever filters and regular expressions to strip out the data you want, clean it up a bit, and the republish that as a new RSS feed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Step 5: run that RSS feed through twitterfeed.com. This will check for updates every 30 minutes, then will actually update a Twitter account with the new information.</li>
</ul>
So what we just did is essentially create a retweet bot. It will automatically search Twitter for new tweets using the #parkourjam hashtag, do a bunch of technical mumbo jumbo back-end magic, then republish any tweet it finds under its own account.

This is obviously useful because now everyone doesn't have to follow everyone else, people only have to follow a single bot.

Cool right? Yeah. But we're not done yet.

Twitter is super phone friendly. You can register your phone with your account, and then you can actually text updates to Twitter. So I can be on campus, find out class is canceled, then without having to go home I can tell people to meet me outside the library in ten minutes to train.

Sweet, right? Sure, but then everyone else still has to be at their computer to see my update. And this is when the project REALLY gets cool.

Remember when I said that Twitter is super phone friendly? Yeah. SUPER phone friendly. You can actually set Twitter up to send you a text message whenever specific people update their Twitter accounts.

Yeah. So suddenly, I can tell everyone who follows this retweet bot that I'm outside the library and I want to train. Where ever they are.

So if your Economics 101 professor is droning on and on about the laws of supply and demand and it's an amazing day outside... You know there is someone who wants to go train. Or if your home alone watching television, or if you dropped the kids off at a birthday party and have a few hours to kill. Suddenly the entire community is at your fingertips. Anyone can plan a jam- either days in advance or minutes in advance.

I feel like this is what Twitter is going to be used for  more and more in the future. With a bit of creativity, out of the box thinking, and knowing what tools are out there and what they're capable of, you can decentralize planning while centralizing community.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I had a dream last night, and I'd like to share it with the world.

<img style="float: right; margin: 10px;" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/148/350241966_d57f45cd46.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="100" /> It started off and we were at the Whole Foods near Jesse Danger's house (there is no Whole Foods near Jesse's house), and there were a bunch of parkour people hanging out. Someone comes up and tells me they got the car, and we go over. The car looked kind of like the Corvette LT-1, but about a billion times shinier and better. They handed me the keys and we got in. There was a stickshift, but I never needed to shift between gears. There were, however, about 12-15 different orientations it could be in (including some sort of turbo boost).

So we started driving down this highway. We were going pretty fast, I looked down and it was about 35mph. I thought "We can go faster than this." So then I hit the gas and we sped up to about 80-90mph. I hit the "turbo boost" somehow, and then we were going about 300mph. At one point we saw a turn coming up and I said to the guy in the passenger seat "Oh crap." I pulled the e-brake, executed a perfect skid around the corner, and then we kept going.

Finally, we drive into this cave. There is still road, but the walls are right up against the edge of the car. I hit the turbo boost and we're going about 400mph when the view switches to 3rd person of the car. <img style="float: left; margin: 10px;" src="http://www.labicheaerospace.com/images/flybyq3.gif" alt="" width="100" />Jet fighter wings fold out from the car, scraping and sparking against the walls. The whole car is on fire - but it's white fire. Then we hit this massive jump and glide for about a mile.

Next, it's me and my friend in this cave (no car), and we get to a door. "You have to write something insulting to get in" he says. So I inscribe with my feet on the ceiling "Write and die." We enter a living room style area. My friend Graham is there, along with the guy we were going to meet. The guy immediately jumps up and starts demanding who we are and how we got in here when Graham interrupts and says that we're with him.

The guy suddenly becomes friendly and welcoming, but in a very "mafia boss" kind of way. There are other people around who seem to be there for the same event as me. I mash some macaroni and cheese with chicken in it on the guys face (that's what was expected of me) and then the dream ends.

Someone woke me up in the morning and I immediately reply "I was having an office space dream." I'm not sure what that means, or if I was having a dream about office space afterward - but I'm glad I remembered this one instead.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Safety has EVERYTHING to do with Fitness</title>
		<link>http://www.zaccohn.com/2010/02/safety-has-everything-to-do-with-fitness/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Based on a forum post where someone stated that advanced practitioners were more likely to get hurt than beginners:

<img style="float: right; margin: 10px;" src="http://hphotos-snc1.fbcdn.net/hs173.snc1/6496_523007492139_50800261_31057227_2545832_n.jpg" alt="" width="150" />Safety is largely a skill/mental attitude. You can go about a difficult jump with safety in mind, using spotters, progression, and building up to it - or you can just go for it. Most of us choose to go the route of safety - but sometimes someone doesn't know how to be safe. It's an inherent skill to some extent, but must be actively developed or TAUGHT (which is something all three gyms (APEX, Primal, PKV) focus on.) To address later points, these gyms don't just say "Do X and Y and never do A and B." They teach with safety in mind, and through that teaching style students learn how to be safe on their own.

However, I do think Rafe is right about the quote "Safety has got nothing to do with fitness." being incorrect. On Saturday, I took either the worst, or the second worst, bail of my life (parkour, flipping, gymnastics, martial arts, slacklining, firespinning, waterskiiing, wakeboarding all included). The only reason I am probably not paralyzed right now is because of my strength, fitness, skill, and experience.

<img style="float: left; margin: 10px;" src="http://hphotos-snc1.fbcdn.net/hs189.snc1/6331_595299363385_24416838_34815013_4495659_n.jpg" alt="" width="150" />I wasn't doing anything dangerous, just a simple step up to crane with my off leg. I stepped, leapt, my foot landed on the top, but I had a little bit too much forward momentum and I pitched forward, head first, feet in the air, toward the concrete on the other side. It was about a 4 foot drop, and all I remember is a snapshot of the concrete about 2 feet from my face, and my right arm outstretched toward the ground.

Based on the map of my (extremely minor) injuries and scrapes, I contacted the ground with the blade of my right hand and braced with the palm of my left, lowered myself down into a roll. I hit my thigh on the corner of the wall, and I must have hit my knee at some point - probably during the roll.

I ended on my back, eyes closed, on the concrete. My right leg was extended, and my left knee was bent about 45 degrees. The person I was training with came over, and I calmly asked her to extend my knee and help me unzip my jacket so I could breathe. I walked away about 2 minutes later, and now about 36 hours later the only remaining pain/tightness/soreness is in my thigh, which is greatly diminished.

I was doing something easy and simple. This was something a beginner could probably do. I am sure, however, that this was not something a beginner could have walked away from so easily. I consider myself somewhat strong, but I still do things that are largely not risky. I take great care not to put myself in any unnecessary or excessive danger. This was a technique that was not excessively dangerous. But just like any technique, if the right thing goes wrong at the perfect time...

<img style="float: right; margin: 10px;" src="http://hphotos-snc1.fbcdn.net/hs171.snc1/6410_130025262704_529932704_2496515_1968869_n.jpg" alt="" width="150" />Physical strength is JUST AS IMPORTANT as mental strength. You can not say that a beginner is exposed to less danger because it simply isn't true. You can not say that because I am stronger, I have to take more risks. Because I was stronger, I am able to move my fingers to type this right now. Life is a long road and we must be strong in order to walk it to it's destination.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is an excerpt taken from the editor's note of the August 1986 edition of Analog: Science Fiction, Science Fact magazine. Analog is one of the longest running science fiction literature magazines, and authors from Timothy Zahn (of Star Wars Expanded Universe fame) to Isaac Asimov have written for them.

I found this issue in an antique shop in Seattle, and the message here really spoke to me. I wasn't able to find a copy of it online, and I think this is something people should be more aware of:
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;" href="http://walksigns.com/images/one_way.gif"><img src="http://walksigns.com/images/one_way.gif" border="0" alt="" width="141" height="200" /></a></div>
"Once upon a time there was a little town in the midst of a sea of fertile farmland. it had a downtown - not a big one, to be sure, or truly bustling, by cosmic standards; but a central district where a few main highways came together and townsfolk and farmers from the surrounding countryside converged to do business. One day this town decided to make all its downtown streets one-way - and many onlookers, both residents and outsiders passing through, wondered why. It didn't seem to them that the actual volume of traffic required such action, and in fact the resulting confusion seemed more of a headache than the "congestion" the new arrangement was supposed to alleviate. Some of these perplexed observers thought the matter over at some length, and the best explanation they could come up with for a tranquil little town's making its streets one-way was this. Much as a little girl might like to dress up in her mother's clothes because it makes her feel "like a big girl," a little city might adopt big-city traffic patterns to make itself feel like a big city.

A bit far-fetched, you may say, but several years later I still haven't heard a better explanation. Admittedly such analogies between the behavior of individual organisms and that of social units are imperfect, at best. There are such obvious differences as the fact that the decision to make streets one-way was made by a few individuals, not by the town as a whole (though that difference may not be as great as it appears, since the little girl's decision to dress up was made by a similarly small group of her cells). In any case, there are also clear similarities in the behaviors of organisms at individual and group levels. It can be at least mildly entertaining, and perhaps even instructive, to look at what they are.

The one I'm particularly thinking about today concerns a common tendency among adults which you've probably noticed in others and very likely exhibited at least occasionally in yourself. How often have you heard an adult beset by some problem like taxes or work pressures of family responsibilities sigh nostalgically that he wishes he were back in his childhood, without any worries? I've heard it often - and I've always considered it a clear sign that the adult's memory of childhood is, at best, exceedingly vague. Any child could remind you that childhood is anything but carefree. Every day is filled with concerns like what's-my-teacher-going-to-do-to-me-if-I-forget-my-book-report and is-that-bully-going-to-catch-me-on-the-way-to-school and am-I-growing-up-the-way-I-should and why-don't-boys-like-me.
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/files/imagecache/news/files/20080206_problem_solving.jpg"><img src="http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/files/imagecache/news/files/20080206_problem_solving.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="189" height="200" /></a></div>
"Ah," the adult smiles wistfully, "but those are such TRIVIAL problems compared to mine!"

To which I reply, with all possible respect, hogwash. The measure of a problem is not how big it is compared to somebody else's, but how big it is compared to your own perception of your ability to solve it. In those terms, a child's problems are not one whit less formidable than an adult's, and they may even be far more so. (Especially when you consider that the current crop of children are exposed to an unprecedented amount of information about current events and are well aware that many adult problems directly affect them, but are completely beyond their control.) A child's problems may loom large primarily because he lacks the perspective to accurately judge their real seriousness. If he's lucky, by adulthood he will be able to evaluate them more realistically and thus be less likely to let his worries get out of proportion to their causes (though many adults, alas, are not that lucky)."

The article goes on to talk about how this applies at a cultural and global level, which is just as important, but for another time. What do you think of this editor's note? Do you agree? Disagree?]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I'm surprised nobody's commented on this article.  It is all very much true, and I believe that a large portion of parent-child misunderstandings has to do with adults forgetting what childhood truly entails.  Everyone's bigger than you, you can't make your own decisions, and how many times did you hear, "Because I said so!" when you asked, "Why?"  What did we ever learn from that?  Why didn't they just tell us instead of infantilizing us, assuring us that we would "understand when we're older".

I relish the times I can go visit my grandparents and "play child" for a weekend, but it's a fairytale version of what childhood was actually like.]]></wp:comment_content>

<a style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="http://www.zaccohn.com/Pics/blog/guerrilla/gorilla.jpg"></a>

[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="209" caption="Not this kind of guerilla."]<img class=" " title="Guerilla Compliments" src="http://gorillasafariadventure.com/images/Gorilla2.jpg" alt="Guerilla Compliments" width="209" height="267" />[/caption]

</div>
<div>I have become enamored by the concept of guerrilla movements. The Princeton Dictionary defines a guerrilla as "a member of an irregular armed force that fights a stronger force by sabotage and harassment." Typically, the term guerrilla refers to warfare. People who fight with guns and bombs to inspire fear and terror in the enemy. I prefer a broader interpretation of the definition, where any tool or medium might be used to inspire any emotion.</div>
During February 2010, the Washington DC area experienced what came to be known as "The Snowpocolypse." Almost 4 feet of snow over the course of a weekend paralyzed most of the area. Events like this are stressful and dreaded by most adults, but to an equal intensity excite kids and teenagers everywhere because it means two things: 1) No school, and 2) snow shovels come out and it's time to make some money.
<a style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="http://www.zaccohn.com/Pics/blog/guerrilla/snowangel.jpg"></a><a style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="http://www.zaccohn.com/Pics/blog/guerrilla/snowangel.jpg"></a><a style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="http://www.zaccohn.com/Pics/blog/guerrilla/snowangel.jpg"></a><a style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="http://www.zaccohn.com/Pics/blog/guerrilla/snowangel.jpg"></a><a style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="http://www.zaccohn.com/Pics/blog/guerrilla/snowangel.jpg"></a>

This has become a normal part of life, and no one is really opposed to kids making a bit of money by doing some hard physical labor. But my friends and I had another idea. We adopted a guerrilla shoveling strategy: We'd pick a house (often one we knew had older residents), swarm up, shovel the driveway (because there were six of us, we'd clear a driveway in 2 or 3

[caption id="attachment_92" align="alignleft" width="300" caption="Snow Angel"]<a href="http://www.zaccohn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/snowangel.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-92 " title="Snow Angel" src="http://www.zaccohn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/snowangel-300x199.jpg" alt="Snow Angel" width="300" height="199" /></a>[/caption]

minutes), and then we'd quickly evacuate out of sight. We wouldn't knock on the door, we wouldn't charge them or even tell them who shoveled their driveway. We did this throughout the neighborhood (We got caught only once. It took us 5 minutes to convince her we really weren't looking for money. At this point, she came out and gave us apples and ginger ale. We decided this was a valid payment and graciously accepted it). I found out later that we apparently hit the editor of the community newsletter. She saw us running away, saw what we had done, and was inspired to write a whole article called "Snow Angels." An excerpt from the article she wrote:
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">
</span>

<em><span style="color: #cccccc;"><span style="font-size: small;">"I was left with much more than a cleared driveway.  More importantly, I was left... </span></span></em>
<em><span style="color: #cccccc;"><span style="font-size: small;">...with a greater faith in the character of the upcoming generation, </span></span></em>
<em><span style="color: #cccccc;"><span style="font-size: small;">...with a hope, that the example of their kindness be recognized and spread, </span></span></em>
<em><span style="color: #cccccc;"><span style="font-size: small;">...and with a sense of charity, that we all recognize the generosity of others and continue to pay forward the good will which we are blessed."</span></span></em>

Since then, I've become interested in this concept of anonymity - doing good not only without expecting to be thanked, but by making it impossible to be personally thanked (or at least very difficult). During a conversation last night with <a href="http://changeexperiment.blogspot.com/">Jesse Danger</a>, I was hit with an idea. I call it "Guerrilla Compliments."
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>
I took a pad of Post-it notes and wrote a short, positive message on each. Some were cliche sounding

[caption id="attachment_93" align="alignright" width="240" caption="Post It Note"]<a href="http://www.zaccohn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/postit.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-93" title="Post It Note" src="http://www.zaccohn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/postit.jpg" alt="Post It Note" width="240" height="230" /></a>[/caption]

mood-boosters (The world is beautiful, and you are too), some were positive suggestions (Dreams are not just for when you are asleep), and others were calls-to-action (Make moves, not excuses). I wrote about 15 unique messages, stuffed them in my pocket, and went to campus for the day.

I've used about half of the notes I wrote so far. A few places that I've put Post-it notes today: Snuck one into a girl's open backpack. On a janitor's floor scrubbing machine. The 5th tray from the top of the stack of food trays in the dining hall. Each time, I take a picture of the post it note (on the target if possible, although most times I take the picture earlier so I can decide on a target at the last second), and then post it to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/zacharycohn">Twitter</a> through <a href="http://twitpic.com/photos/ZacharyCohn">Twitpic</a> with a description of where I just put it. I'm tagging each post with the hashtag #guerrillacompliments.
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>

[caption id="attachment_95" align="alignleft" width="300" caption="Post It Dreams"]<a href="http://www.zaccohn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/dreams.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-95" title="Post It Dreams" src="http://www.zaccohn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/dreams-300x225.jpg" alt="Post It Dreams" width="300" height="225" /></a>[/caption]

I hope that people are surprised when they find a yellow Post-it note somewhere they weren't expecting. And I am hoping that this surprise will encourage them to read, consider, and really embrace what is written on it. Maybe they will just throw the note away without reading it. But maybe one of these will brighten someone's day. Maybe it will inspire them to engage in their own spontaneous act of kindness. Maybe the encouraging Post-it notes telling people that "The only difference between dreams and reality is action" will cause someone to stop hesitating and take some action to change their lives. So many people go days, weeks, or months without a single positive or encouraging word said to them.

Lets change that.

Guerrilla soldiers fight a stronger force by sabotage and harassment. Lets be guerrilla soldiers, waging a war against unhappiness, with Post-its and pens as our weapons. If you want to join my war, I welcome you to show support by posting your own attacks on unhappiness to Twitter with the hashtag #guerrillacompliments. Don't have a Twitter? Then don't worry about it. The important goal here is to get out, and do good.

I'm going to inspire hope and joy where ever I strike. And I will strike every day. Will you?]]></content:encoded>

Traceurs traveled a lot more. For national jams, for state jams, but also just to travel. Over the past year or so, I've noticed less and less of this. Sometimes traceurs won't even travel to the next town over, unless it's a big event (and even then).

I've identified a few reasons for this. A big one is that there simply isn't the need. It's the same reasons that Parkour forums aren't nearly as popular as they were four years ago. Why do you need to get online to talk about Parkour when you can just go outside with your friends and do it? Why should you drive an hour to train with people when you have your own community right here?

These are legitimate points. There was a time when I'd drive an hour to DC every weekend just to train with my friends there. I'd be there for 4 or 5 hours, then drive back. Factor in a teenagers sleep schedule, and there's a whole Saturday. I remember when it was a big deal to find out there were other people training in our town. What?? We don't have to drive all the way to DC just to train with other people!? Awesome!! (And then ALL of us would drive down to DC together...)

But it is still important to travel. Further than just your county, further than just your state. For reasons other than just National Jams. A friend of mine was recently interested in starting a Parkour gym, and came to me for advice. I wrote him a long letter, and the jist was that I was honestly concerned that he hadn't traveled enough.

Everyone who has started a "brick and mortar" Parkour gym (i.e. not running out of someone else's facility) has traveled extensively. To other communities, to other gyms, to other countries. Like my friend, they pretty much started their local community, but unlike my friend, they had seen how Parkour is being taught in Seattle, Denver, San Francisco, Washington DC, North Carolina, Toronto, London, Paris, Lisses, Sydney, Tokyo. In addition to having experienced all these different methods of teaching, they have developed an extensive network of people to bounce ideas off of, learn from, and from which to gather support.

This is not just an article for people who want to start their own gym. This is an article for everyone who wants to really understand Parkour. Traveling is a NECESSITY. You should visit old communities, communities with gyms, and newer less developed communities. Always be looking out for things to learn, even when someone isn't trying to teach you something.

So this is my challenge to you, whether you are a newer traceur, or just someone who never really got around to visiting anywhere else:

You don't have to go to Lisses to go on a pilgrimage. Spend 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, some significant length of time. Contact a few Parkour communities you haven't ever been to. Preferably ones far away. Tell them you want to come visit, and ask if you can you stay with anyone. Stay for a few days, then go off to the next place. Keep a journal (or a blog) and record everything you learn and everything you feel during your trip so the world can learn from your experience.

Let distance be your obstacle, and cars, busses, trains and planes be your vaults.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I travel to the next town over (&#39;Bout a 30 Minute drive) a couple times of month when I can to train with the local traceurs. Because all of us are used to our gym (Revolution Parkour), its a whole different enviroment to be training outside. <br /><br />Also, once a year or so we travel down to OSU and have a huge training day there. 90 minute drive down there, and we&#39;re there for a good 5-6 hours. We hit up the local buildings, parks, everything. Its a real blast. One of these days I want to be able to travel down to San Fran or up to Seattle to train with some of the groups there. Bonus points if I can ever make it to a national jam in Washington or Cali.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I agree with your point about traceurs needing to travel and get more perspective from outside their own communities, BUT...<br /><br />I don&#39;t think it&#39;s entirely true that there are less traceurs traveling. It used to be out of necessity but also because the people who were getting into parkour in the beginning wanted to be a part of something larger. Sounds like when you were starting you were always traveling to DC to hang out with those guys, but it was always the same place, wasn&#39;t it? In that sense you were basically only getting two perspectives, and that&#39;s about as much traveling anyone ever did. My solution when I got started was to try to build up my local community as big as possible, which was difficult, but I had no way of getting to LA from San Diego easily.<br /><br />Now I&#39;ve been lucky enough to get opportunities to train with other communities, but it really takes going FAR outside of your community to experience the benefits. Not from Berkeley to Sacramento, for example, but from Berkeley to Seattle, to Boulder, to Vancouver, etc. We should be training with people we have never even talked to before, that&#39;s how we&#39;ll get strong new perspectives.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I think this is an area of my post that I could have improved with proofreading. As I brought up in a discussion with Dale on the facebook comments on this post, &quot;The important part isn&#39;t that you travel - it&#39;s that you travel to new places all the time.&quot;<br /><br />I definitely agree with you, 100%. I didn&#39;t mention it in the article, but in addition to going to DC on a regular basis, we&#39;d train around our town, and go out to visit other traceurs in other places around Maryland. People should always be traveling in their &quot;local-ish area,&quot; but the scope of the post was more to remind people that that isn&#39;t enough.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I can't believe I'm here writing this. All my life I never thought it would happen to me, you know? I always thought I could fight it, I wouldn't be the guy who gives in. I've been making fun of the people who do as long as I can remember. The snide remarks, the slightly-less-than-playful jokes. I thought I was stronger than they were, better, cooler. But no - last Friday I gave in... I broke.

My name is Zachary Cohn... and I just switched to Mac.

I've been thinking about it for a while. The sleek unibody aluminum design, the efficiency resulting from it all being designed to work together, a unix base under the hood with a user friendly blanket on top. It was pretty tempting.

[caption id="attachment_101" align="alignleft" width="300" caption="I threw it all away... FOR THIS!"]<a href="http://www.zaccohn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/macbookpro1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-101" title="Confessions of a Mac Switcher" src="http://www.zaccohn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/macbookpro1-300x221.jpg" alt="I just switched to Mac" width="300" height="221" /></a>[/caption]

I've been using Windows for all my life. Started with 3.1, then 95, then 98. After a brief stint with ME, I got my first XP box. It was awesome! I knew how it worked, inside and out, I had grown up with it, and life was good. I built a desktop and got a laptop. My desktop slowly became a Frankenbox, my laptop got stolen and replaced with my current one. I graduated college, moved to Seattle, and now only have my laptop. It's definitely mine, covered in bumper stickers ranging from Streetlight Manifesto to TechTV, American Parkour to Unicycle.com.

But my laptop is dying. It's old, it's slow, and last time I tried to install linux on it, it was a disaster (Several pieces of my hardware aren't supported). A fresh install of XP (won't run 7) would probably get me another 6 months out of it or so, but recently the battery has gone to hell, it's been BSODing, fans have been failing, and it's overheating like crazy. It was time to move on, and I figured with Black Friday right around the corner, I should hold out until then.

I wanted something reasonably state of the art. It didn't have to be a powerhouse, but I wanted something that wasn't going to be completely obsolete AND useless in a week. I wanted something with solid state hard drives. They cost a penny or two, but I think they're worth it. Mostly I wanted something that had a unified user experience, that was sleek and user friendly and all the pieces were designed to work together... so I started looking at Macs.

I spec'd out a specific one: 15", i5 core, 128gb solid state, 4gb of ram a while ago. Then I waited for Black Friday and watched the Refurbished section on the Apple store. Black Friday came around, and while their deals weren't that impressive (and didn't seem to stack with the educational discount), something of interested popped up on the Refurbished section. 15", i7 core, 128gb ssd, 4gb of ram.

So I bought it. And it arrives later this week. I can count the number of times I've used a Mac on my fingers, and now I'm taking the jump. I have no idea how to use one, I don't know how to install (or even find!) programs on it. But I guess we'll see how it goes...

I'll be using this blog series to chronicle my experiences learning to use a Mac. Check back when I receive my new laptop later this week for Part 2 of ???]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[This is pretty close to my switch. I've used linux since 94' (as my main workstation) and windows desktops since 95; Never once was I interested in the mac experience. After tiring of linux driver issues (not really at the fault of linux developers), and not having the time to hack my own anymore... Feeling uncomfortable in the windows development environment, and appreciating the fact that i don't have to spend 800$ on xcode etc. I decided after my younger brother made the Mac jump maybe I should give it a try; after all I can't show my age, and I should maybe attempt to accept change :).

So I went to apple store online, used my employee discount and purchased a brand new 13.3" macbook air.. I really do love this machine, it's an engineering marvel in terms of laptops IMO. The OS itself....it's just ok so far, I don't find it as intuitive as everyone says...maybe I've been spoiled by years of apt get who knows? I'm learning to like the UI and like most interfaces they tend to grow on you.

I'm currently working on a game for iOS and a cocoa app for my mac...So far so good. At this point in time I'm glad I made the switch and I don't believe I'll be making the trip back. Oh one of the hardest things I've had so far is finding replacement applications for things like inkscape and gimp etc, most don't feel as well made (might pay for pixelator). Macports are a life saver too. I'm working my way to the finish line on gui tools though, and I'm happy I spent the $ for textmate even though it's future may not look totally bright. I'd be curious to hear about alternative applications you will end up using. I'll stop rambling now because my grammar and spelling blow.]]></wp:comment_content>

What are some of your favorite sites to use for mac applications and stuff? So far my plan is Step 1) Google. Step 2) ???. Step 3) Profit?]]></wp:comment_content>

You don't really need any for the general things but for producing documents I use iWork or Office both of which you can get from apple.com. For coding I use TextMate from macromates (although I'm moving towards MacVim) or xCode (which is on your install disks), for ftp and such I use Transmit and for design i use Omnigraffle (like Visio only.. better) and the Adobe Creative Suite.

Good luck.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>Confessions of a Mac Switcher: Part 2</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My name is Zachary Cohn, and I am now a Mac user.

So in Part 1 of this series, I was talking about how I felt after I ordered my new Macbook Pro, but hadn't received it yet. It arrived Saturday night, but I didn't get a chance to open the box until Sunday.

If there's one thing Apple focuses on (this shouldn't be a surprise), it's the experience. Even just opening the box was impressive.

Once I got it out of the box, I scanned through the manual, then opened it up. Within 2 minutes, everything was configured and I was staring at that the desktop.

Aaaand then I didn't really know what to do from there. I decided to start moving through the System Preferences. I figured the best way to get familiar with a new OS was to see what I could change!

So after an hour or two of tinkering, I have the dock set up to hide on the left, maximizing my screen real estate. I've learned about the different multi-touch options, and best of all... discovered the keyboard shortcuts window! This is something I never thought about, but it's astounding how obvious it is once you see it. Windows doesn't have a global keyboard shortcuts menu... you just have to figure them out as you go. Windows key + M minimizes, Windows key + E opens Windows Explorer... there's no way anyone could find a list of all of those in windows anywhere. But on the Mac, there's just a huge list. So I've been learning those, and it's been pretty sweet.

Installing programs was weird. People say it's easier than on Windows, but I would argue the whole process is a bit less intuitive. I needed a friend to explain to me that you download a .dmg, then you can drag and drop it to the applications folder, then you have to unmount it to get rid of the icon. On windows, you can just double click on the file
you downloaded and hit next-next-next until it's set up. I won't say I don't like this method, I just don't think it's necessarily better.

So far, I've downloaded and installed Firefox, VLC, and Flash. The first two were fine, I had some trouble getting Flash to work. It installed fine, but Youtube videos wouldn't work. I tried a few times and eventually it worked... so whatever. *shrug* 

The biggest thing I've noticed so far is that IT IS FAST. Part of this is definitely the fact that it's a new computer with a fresh OS, and another big part is that it's using a solid state drive. But either way, it wakes up from sleep before I can finish opening the screen, and all applications pretty much load instantly.

I think the best way to describe the colors on the screen would be "vibrant." Even looking just at individual icons, it's very impressive.

I think those are most of my initial impressions. All I've done on it so far are dick around with some settings and watch an episode of Dexter though. I'm planning on migrating some old files tonight, and if I can get that done maybe make use of what's running under the hood. I found <a href="http://www.stratumsecurity.com/blog/2010/12/03/shearing-firesheep-with-the-cloud/" title="Securing Surfing on Open Wireless Networks">this project on HN</a> a week or two ago, and I want to try it out.

The only other thing I want at this point would be one of these <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QQ8IO6?ie=UTF8&tag=zaccom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002QQ8IO6">babies...</a>
That's a lot of screen real estate I'm sure I could find ways to fill.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I converted about 5 years ago after dreaming about owning a mac for years prior to that.  I am a true believer in all things mac.

I would recommend trying out Google Chrome for your browser.  I have found that firefox and safari have brain farts sometimes, but Chrome is great.  If something does mess up in Chrome it just kills that one page and lets you decide what do to.

Keep up the blogging too.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I would also recommend Chrome; its OS X version is, quite honestly, the best of the bunch.

Regarding Safari, I normally wouldn't recommend it.  Despite having a fantastic backend, the frontend does a metric ****-ton of hard drive i/o that just bogs the entire system down.  However, it may be a different experience for you as you're running on a solid state drive.  I say give Safari a go.  

Firefox has an extremely accurate rendering, but it is very slow compared to other browsers and leaks memory like there's no tomorrow.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>Tunnel Under the (NYTimes) Paywall</title>
		<link>http://www.zaccohn.com/2011/03/tunnel-under-the-nytimes-wall/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On Monday, the New York Times' paywall went live, preventing readers from reading more than 20 articles a month. There are some unusual quarks to this paywall though, such as visitors who click through a Twitter link bypass the paywall. Now, I'm all for the Newspaper industry trying to make money, but this is such a silly way to do it... So I decided to demonstrate how easy it is to "tunnel under" the paywall.

My original idea was to create a Twitter account (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/TunnelUnderWall" title="Tunnel Under the Wall">@TunnelUnderWall</a>) and stream every New York Times article through Twitter but I found out someone already did this, so I figured I'd turn this into a "How To Build Your Own Free New York Times Newsfeed" post and show how to make personalized ones just for you.

Step 1:
Head to the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com" title="New York Times">New York Times</a> website and scroll all the way to the bottom. Click on the "RSS" link.

<img src="http://www.zaccohn.com/images/tunnel/nyt1.PNG" title="Tunnel Under the Wall" alt="New York Times - RSS Feed" width="400"/>

Handily, the New York Times has separated all of their sections into separate RSS feeds. Interested in Asian Politics and Technology? You can make a custom feed for just that. More interested in Fashion, Health, and Religion? Got you covered.

Step 2:
Next, you're going to make use of <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/" title="Yahoo Pipes">Yahoo! Pipes.</a> This is a service that reads in RSS feeds (RSS isn't dead, it's just sleeping), lets you hack them to pieces, then export it as a new feed. Don't get intimidated by Yahoo! Pipes, it's not as complicated as it looks. 

Open up a new tab and sign up for a Yahoo! Pipes account (you'll need a Yahoo account). On the left, open up "Sources" and drag a "Fetch Feed" box into the gridded area. 


<img src="http://www.zaccohn.com/images/tunnel/pipes1.PNG" alt="Yahoo Pipes" width="400"/>

Step 3:
Switch over to the RSS page of the New York Times you opened up earlier. At this point, we need to choose the categories of news we want. Make sure you right click and copy the target URL, if you actually go to the page it redirects you somewhere else. 

Step 4: 
Switch back to Yahoo! Pipes and paste that URL into the Fetch Feed. Go back and forth between until you have all your categories pasted over. You'll end up with something that looks like this:

<img src="http://www.zaccohn.com/images/tunnel/pipes2.PNG" alt="Yahoo Pipes" width="400"/>

Step 5:
Okay, before you look at the next picture... Don't panic. It's not as bad as it looks. This is what's next:

<img src="http://www.zaccohn.com/images/tunnel/pipes3.PNG" alt="Yahoo Pipes" width="400"/>

Haven't panicked yet? Good. This is what we're going to do:
<ul>
	<li>In Yahoo! Pipes, on the left menu go to "Operators." You'll want to drag out a "Sort," "Filter" and "Unique" operator box onto your workgrid. </li>
        <li>Go to "Date" on the left menu and pull out a "Date Builder."</li>
        <li>Fill in the information as seen in the above example, replacing the date given with today's date.</li>
        <li>Connect the blue and grey dots as shown in above example. Placement of the squares doesn't matter, as long as they're connected correctly.</li>
</ul>

Step 6: 
Congrats! The hard part is over! Save the pipe, then hit "Run pipe."

<img src="http://www.zaccohn.com/images/tunnel/pipes4.PNG" alt="Yahoo Pipes" width="400"/>

Step 7:
There shouldn't be any errors if you copied the correct URLs into Fetch Feed. If there aren't any errors, hit "Publish feed," "Get RSS" and then copy the URL.

<img src="http://www.zaccohn.com/images/tunnel/pipes5.PNG" alt="Yahoo Pipes" width="400"/>

Step 8:
We're done with Yahoo! Pipes, and ready to move onto our next service: <a href="http://twitterfeed.com/" title="Twitterfeed">TwitterFeed</a>. Sign up for an account, and put in the RSS feed Yahoo! Pipes gave you. Go to "Advanced Settings" and switch to "5 updates" at a time and make sure it updates every 30 minutes.

<img src="http://www.zaccohn.com/images/tunnel/twitterfeed1.PNG" alt="Twitterfeed" width="400"/>

Step 9:
Open a new tab, and start a new <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> account. You can use any username - this is a personalized feed for you. If you'd like, you can set it to publish privately so only you have access to it. 

Step 10:
Switch back to Twitterfeed and connect to your Twitter account.

<img src="http://www.zaccohn.com/images/tunnel/twitterfeed2.PNG" alt="Twitterfeed" width="400"/>

And you should be done! Give the Twitter account a half an hour or so and it will start updating. Follow the Twitter account you created on Twitter, or just reference it whenever you want to read an article. 

Have fun tunneling under the New York Times' paywall!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My name is Zachary Cohn, and I've met a lot of people from the Internet. Most recently I met my doppelganger, Zachary Cohen. 

[caption id="attachment_133" align="alignleft" width="150" caption="The Internet is a Series of Tubes"]<a href="http://www.zaccohn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/the-internet-a-series-of-tubes.jpg"><img src="http://www.zaccohn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/the-internet-a-series-of-tubes-300x262.jpg" alt="Meeting People from The Internet" title="The Internet is a Series of Tubes" width="150" height="150" class="size-medium wp-image-133" /></a>[/caption]Meeting people from the Internet is not a big deal to me anymore, although other people still freak out when I mention it. There have been three primary circles I've met people from: Massassi, Parkour, and The Rest of the Internet. The first two really helped me be comfortable with the last one.


<a href="http://www.massassi.net" title="Massassi">Massassi.net</a> started in 1997 and was dedicated to editing and modding a Star Wars game called Dark Forces 2: Jedi Knight. The game is now 14 years old, and except for the occasional game for “old times sake” no one has played in five years. But everyone was such good friends and the community was so tight that most people have stayed around. I found Massassi in 2001, and have checked it daily since. 

The first person I met from the Internet was through Massassi, and was probably Gebhoq. I found out he lived about 20 minutes away, so we saw a play and grabbed lunch together. After that, I visited Rochester Institute of Technology, where I was going to go to school. There were six people from Massassi that, by chance, all ended up there, so we met up and they showed me around. I've met a bunch more people from Massassi, but I had talked daily with most of them for years, so it was more like reuniting with a long-time friend.

The next circle of internet meetings is through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkour" title="Parkour">Parkour</a>. When I first started training, there was no one experienced in my area. I saw on some local parkour forums that a bunch of people meeting up to train in Washington DC, so I drove down to meet them. I showed up in this park to find a dozen teenage boys, mostly shirtless, jumping, climbing, and flipping around. I was a bit nervous at first - I didn't even know most of their handles, let alone names or anything about them. Five minutes after introducing myself, I felt we'd known each other for years. Since that first parkour jam, I've been great friends with Leonn, Psychosis, Doc_Ahk, Kipup, and RPG.[caption id="attachment_135" align="alignright" width="150" caption="David Belle - Parkour"]<a href="http://www.zaccohn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/David_Belle.jpg"><img src="http://www.zaccohn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/David_Belle-150x150.jpg" alt="David Belle - Parkour" title="David Belle - Parkour" width="150" height="150" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-135" /></a>[/caption]

After that I was 100% comfortable meeting traceurs (people who train parkour) in person, to the point where I traveled for 8 weeks to 21 different cities one summer, and never spent a dime on housing – I just crashed on couches the entire time. I'd post up on the parkour forums for some city I've never been to, say I'm passing through, and I'd have people fighting over who would host me. My favorite meeting was stepping off a Greyhound Bus in Minneapolis at 4:15am, stumbling onto the street and looking at this guy standing by a car. I walk up and he says sleepily, “Happydud?” (My online handle for a while), I respond back just as sleepily “Krat0r?” Then we decide to go back to his place, sleep for another six hours, then formally introduce ourselves later that morning. 

After meeting Massassians and spending weeks with people through Parkour, I've come to fully internalize the idea that strangers from the internet are no different then strangers in your neighborhood. A few weeks ago after a typo'd tweet, I was introduced to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ZacharyCohen" title="@ZacharyCohen">@ZacharyCohen</a> (My handle is <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ZacharyCohn" title="@ZacharyCohn">@ZacharyCohn</a>). He had the middle name I've always wanted (Adam, so his initials spell his name – Z.A.C.). He's interested in a lot of the same things I'm interested in, and he lived in NYC. Conveniently enough, I had an overnight layover in NYC coming up! So last night I showed up at New York Penn Station and went to my doppelganger's condo. He opened the door and said “Hello, Zac!” I replied “Hello, Zac!” and it was like we were best friends. We hung out for a few hours, talked a lot, and there wasn't a single awkward “you're a stranger from the internet” type moment.

[caption id="attachment_136" align="alignleft" width="150" caption="Networking - It&#039;s Dumb"]<a href="http://www.zaccohn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/social-networking-image1.jpg"><img src="http://www.zaccohn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/social-networking-image1-150x150.jpg" alt="Networking - It&#039;s Dumb" title="Networking - It&#039;s Dumb" width="150" height="150" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-136" /></a>[/caption]People make a big deal about “networking.” Going to events, meeting people, exchanging business cards, etc. I hate networking. The word leaves a sour taste in my mouth. It feels so fake – like most people want to talk with you long enough to pitch you on what they do, give you a business card hoping you'll need to call them one day, and then they move on to the next person (Not saying all networking events or all people who go to them are like this, but it's undeniably the norm). 

Instead of networking, I want to make friends. I want to find people who are legitimately interesting to me, and legitimately interested in me. I want to talk to them about WHY they do what they do, what they do when they're not at their job, what books they've read, what they think about the Civil War or China's concern for the environment or anything. I don't want to end the conversation with “give me a call, maybe we can help each other out.” I want to end it with “Continue our conversation over lunch next week?”

When I meet people from the internet in person, I guess technically it's “networking.” But if I thought of it that way, I doubt I'd have half the friends I have today.

Stop networking. Start making friends.

DISCLAIMER: While I've had nothing but good experiences with meeting people, there is always the chance you could meet someone with less than honest intentions. Between my decade of martial arts, five years of parkour, and experience meeting people, I am pretty comfortable in these situations. But I am still very aware of potential threats. In the words of Han Solo, “Don't get cocky.” Be safe.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As parkour has grown in popularity, a lot of companies have created and sold parkour shoes. A lot of people ask me what is the best shoe for parkour, so I’ve put together this guide to the most common shoes people might suggest for parkour. This is by no means an exhaustive list, these are just the most common ones that I have enough experience with to review.

One quick note: I am a big fan of minimalist shoes. There’s a lot of research out there that shows that the more padding and cushioning a shoe has, the MORE damage it does to your feet, knees, and hips. That’s out of the scope of this article though.

Full disclosure: In early 2010 I received some free Ariakes from K-Swiss. This has not influenced my review, but I wanted to be transparent. 

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TGYFJ2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=zaccom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creativeASIN=B000TGYFJ2"><u><strong>K-Swiss Ariake</strong></u></a>
[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="150" caption="K-Swiss Ariake Parkour Shoe"]<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TGYFJ2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=zaccom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creativeASIN=B000TGYFJ2"><img alt="Ariake Parkour Shoe" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4159FxC8LyL._AA300_.jpg" title="Ariake Parkour Shoe" width="150" height="150" /></a>[/caption]
<strong>Price:</strong>
Around $100

<strong>Description:</strong>
This was the first shoe created and marketed specifically for Parkour. They’re made by K-Swiss. They sent a lot of free pairs out to traceurs a few years ago to help spread the word about being a Parkour shoe. Many people wearing Ariakes got theirs for free, either directly from K-Swiss or from someone who got them from K-Swiss. They also come in lots of different (and crazy) colors, which can be a pro or a con depending on your preference. :)

<strong>Pros:</strong>
- Pretty good grip on most surfaces in most conditions.
- Pretty flexible
- Flat, solid rubber sole. There’s no dumb plastic arch or anything like that.

<strong>Cons:</strong>
-Can be very slippery on wet metal objects (rails).
-Durability. The toe will rip open, and the lacing holes will start to rip. You can still wear the shoe, but it will sustain cosmetic and eventually structural damage fairly quickly.

<strong>Overall:</strong>
Definitely not a bad shoe. I like shoes with less padding, and while this shoe has some, it doesn’t have a ton. The quality is the biggest problem - the shoe will tear itself apart after 6-8 months of moderate use, 2-4 months of heavy use. The shoe is mostly leather, so it’s a nice shoe to wear to keep your feet slightly drier.


<u><strong>K-Swiss Ariake Lite Mesh</strong></u>
[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="150" caption="K-Swiss Ariake Lite Mesh Parkour Shoe"]<img alt="Ariake Lite Mesh Parkour Shoe" src="http://www.shoebuy.com/pi/kswis/kswis264915_145897_lg.jpg" title="Ariake Lite Mesh Parkour Shoe" width="150" height="80" />[/caption]
<strong>Price:</strong>
Around $110

<strong>Description:</strong>
The Ariake Lite Mesh came out about a year after the Ariake and solved many of the problems with the original shoe. It replaced a lot of the leather with mesh, which made the shoe lighter and breathier. They improved the durability by redesigning the toe and the lace holes so they don’t get damaged as easily.

<strong>Pros:</strong>
- All the pros from the original Ariakes
- Lighter
- Much more durable

<strong>Cons:</strong>
- Slippery when on wet metal objects.
- Since the shoe is mostly made of mesh, it will absorb water rapidly.
- Very difficult to find.

<strong>Overall:</strong>
The Ariake Lite Mesh is one of my favorite Parkour shoes. The biggest downside is that they’re very hard to find. K-Swiss doesn’t sell them directly anymore, so you’ll have to search elsewhere online or get really lucky in a store.

<strong>Price:</strong>
$90

<strong>Description:</strong>
I haven’t owned a pair of these shoes, and so I don’t have extensive personal experience with them. I’ve tried on other peoples’ a few times, and then read a fair bit about them.

<strong>Pros:</strong>
- The rubber is extremely grippy. 5.10 originally made climbing shoes, so this makes a lot of sense.

<strong>Cons:</strong>
- The rubber is extremely grippy. This is also a con, because this extra grippiness can and will hide problems with technique.
- When wearing them, I found them to be a bit clunky. I had a lot of trouble “feeling” the ground under my feet, which makes me very uncomfortable. The padding was just too thick.

<strong>Overall:</strong>
- I’m not a big fan of these shoes (which is why I don’t own a pair). I don’t like the fact the thickness of them, and I think the extreme grip is actually a detriment to someone learning parkour. If I was in a wallrun contest, then I’d wear these parkour shoes, but if I’m just training I’d prefer something more normal.

<strong>Price:</strong>
$15

<strong>Description:</strong>
These are really interesting shoes. They weren’t created for parkour or ever marketed toward traceurs. These are originally martial arts shoes, and are often found in China Towns and martial arts stores. They have a cloth top, a thin, extremely flexible, and pretty grippy bottom, and they have simple laces. The most outstanding part of this shoe is it’s price - between $10 and $20. They only last 3 or 4 months, but they cost a fraction of the price of any of the other speciality parkour shoes. Many people buy 5 pairs of Feiyue’s at a time!

<strong>Pros:</strong>
- Extremely inexpensive.
- Very flexible.
- Very lightweight.
- Very little padding.

<strong>Cons:</strong>
- You’ll wear through the bottoms of them pretty fast.

<strong>Overall:</strong>
I love these shoes. They’re comfortable, flexible, light, and extremely cheap. Buy a couple pairs and be set for a year.

<strong>Price:</strong>
Around $75

<strong>Description:</strong>
I love these shoes. I don’t have a pair yet, but they’re going to be my next shoe purchase. The ultimate minimalist shoe, there is essentially no padding, pretty good grip on most surfaces, and forces you to have perfect technique (in running and walking as well as parkour!)

<strong>Pros:</strong>
- Extremely minimal padding. Expect your landing technique to improve dramatically.
- As long as you get the right size, expect a very snug fit. They shouldn’t be going anywhere!
- Paying a premium actually makes sense for these foot-fitting shoes, as opposed to other shoes that are basically just shells for your feet.
- Will force you to improve landing and precision technique.
- Will improve running technique, which can prevent or fix some foot, ankle, knee, and hip problems.

<strong>Cons:</strong>
- Can be dangerous if you don’t take it slow. It’s imperative you avoid big drops and precisions, at least until you build back up to them.
- Very little protection if something gets dropped on your foot or if you stub your toe.

<strong>Overall:</strong>
The Vibram Five Fingers are really great Parkour shoes. Some people like to “go big” and do big drops - I discourage this because it leads to a higher rate of injuries. If you want to go big, these will not be good shoes for you. If you want to improve your technique, if you want to train and prevent long term injuries, these will be great shoes for you. You’ll pay around the same price as other high end shoes, but these are definitely worth it.

<u><strong>Conclusion</strong></u>
For the dedicated traceur with no budget, I’d recommend the Vibram Five Fingers. If you don’t want to spend that much, but still want a great minimalist shoe, I’d definitely look into (a few pairs of) the Feiyues. If you aren’t interested in a minimalist shoe, the Ariake Lite Mesh and then the regular Ariake would be my recommendation.

That being said, if you’re just getting into parkour, you should ignore everything in this article for a few months. Head over to a general clothing store, find <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TX6WVW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=zaccom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creativeASIN=B002TX6WVW">a pair of cheap $35 cross trainers</a> and use those for a while. Technique is 90% of parkour, owning “the right shoes” is only going to get you a bit farther, and until then it’ll just mask problems with your technique.

<u><strong>Things to look for in a cheap crosstrainer:</strong></u>
- No plastic arch on the bottom.
- Bottom isn’t slick. If you have to, put your foot in the shoe and rub it against a few surfaces to get an idea of how grippy it is.
- Not too much padding or cushioning.

Now get out there and start training! :)]]></content:encoded>

	<li><h3>Keep your money low (There's no point in having money if you're not doing anything with it).</h3>
<p>One of the biggest problems newbies in Starcraft have is when they are “floating money.” This is also referred to as having “Facebook money.” You only get to 3000 minerals and 2500 gas if you're not spending it, and when you're not investing your money in SOMETHING (production buildings, units, supply, upgrades, whatever!), it means you're falling behind. Having 3000 minerals doesn't win you matches, but if you turn that into 60 marines...

Real life is like this too! Piling up money in the bank is money you're not investing! Having some cash is good, but by converting that money into tangible assets you can make it useful.</li>
	<li><h3>Expand, but not when you're spread too thin (Know when to start new projects or activities, and know when to cut back).</h3>
<p>
In any macro Starcraft game (and Real Life is all about Macro), you need to expand your base in order to increase your income and survive. But if you expand at the wrong time, it's easy to get crushed. The timing of your expansion is based on a combination of how far into the game you are, your position relative to your opponents, and a few other factors.
<p>
<table border=0>
<tr>
<td>
[caption id="attachment_154" align="alignleft" width="300" caption="Expand before you&#039;re ready and you might find yourself overwhelmed."]<a href="http://www.zaccohn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tribbles.jpg"><img src="http://www.zaccohn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tribbles-300x225.jpg" alt="Expanding too soon is like feeding Tribbles." title="The Trouble with Tribbles and Expanding" width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-154" /></a>[/caption]
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Real life is just like this! If you don't expand into new projects and into new income streams, you risk getting contained and slowing your growth. But if you expand when you have too much going on, you won't be able to keep up and you will end up in a weaker position than when you started.</li>
<p>
	<li><h3>Have a plan, don't just do whatever (have goals, know when you want to accomplish them).</h3>
<p>
A good Starcraft player starts the game thinking Overlord at 10, scout, 14 pool, 15 hatch, drone to 16, get queen as soon as pool pops, then start reacting to the information you scouted. A bad Starcraft player starts the game thinking “Make some drones. I guess I should make a spawning pool. Oh crap, I'm supply blocked, better make 3 overlords. Oh damnit, it's 6 minutes in and I forgot my queen. Oh damnit, I attacked with 10 zerglings and 6 roaches at 15:00 and he countered with 6 Thors, 30 marines and 4 medivacs. gg I guess.”

Real life is no different. If you wander through life without a plan, you'll get surprised when 20 carriers and a mothership show up at your front door. But if you know that at 22, you want to be working for A Company doing B, and then in two years you want to have gotten C promotion so you can get recruited by Company D to do E for twice your old salary, and to do this you should join groups F and G and probably get published in H and I publications... then you've got a pretty solid plan, and you've got a good idea of how to get there. There will always be a hellion harass, but if you've got your goals and your plan you can react and adapt.</li>
	<li><h3>Scouting is critical (know what's going on in the world).</h3>
<p>
A player who doesn't scout might go mass zealot/immortal when their opponent is going mass Muta. All it would take is an observer or two to see the early lair + double spire and the Protoss player could have adapted and switched to something that can at least HIT mutalisks. In Starcraft, you're playing with other people. If you're going to interact with them, you need to know what they're doing.

The real world has more than just a population of you. You need to be aware of what's going on in your city, in your industry, and in the rest of the world. Events develop, technology is released, and laws are passed that can shut you down like a dark templar rush.</li>
	<li><h3>Fungal is OP (all your eggs in one basket).</h3>
<p>
The Terran Marine Marauder push is a powerful force. Extremely high DPS, their units get slowed down, you can lose a few units without losing a lot of firepower. And then all the sudden, there's green everywhere and all your units are trapped. Seconds later, more green and they're all dead. You just got hit by Fungal Growth. Thousands of minerals down the drain in seconds.

<p>
This can happen in the real world, too. You've invested all your money in the housing industry: your tactic is flip a house and buy two more. And then it's 2008, the housing bubble pops, and your net worth is down 90%. And it doesn't look like the housing industry is recovering. You've lost tens of millions of dollars. If you had invested in the housing industry, but also a few technology startups, a local restaurant franchise, and rare metals like gold, you'd still have taken a hit, but it wouldn't have ruined you.</li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I started programming in tenth grade. I started with a year-long Visual Basic class, then a year long AP Java class. During my senior year of high school, I worked for the National Security Agency (the FBI is who you hear breathing on the other end of the line, and the CIA is the one that topples foreign governments hostile to the USA. We're the good guys). 

One day my manager came up to me and described a fairly complex project he wanted done in Perl. 

“But I don't know Perl.”

“That's okay. Here's six books. (He dropped them on my desk) The rest of the O'Reilly books are on the intranet. Take as long as you need.”

3 months later, I had completed the project. 

I went to Rochester Institute of Technology to study Computer Science because I really enjoyed programming. I loved problem solving, I loved being able to type some characters, then see something happen. And if I changed a few characters? I could make something completely different happen. It's like being an architect, but you don't have to wait years for someone else to build your skyscraper for you. But after a year or so, I realized something. 

I wasn't a particularly stellar developer. 

I certainly wasn't bad - I had a good work ethic, a good attitude, and I really enjoyed programming. I got assignments done in class and I finished a few side projects. But I was solidly in the middle of the pack. And that's when I realized I had a decision to make. 

Did I want to be a mediocre developer, or did I want to be an awesome something else?

I decided I wanted to be an awesome something else. 

I started learning about business, marketing, organization, and leadership by actually DOING it through the <a href="http://www.zaccohn.com/5-cool-things-zac-has-done" title="Five Cool Things Zac Cohn has Done">awesome Rochester parkour community</a> I developed in Rochester. At some point I realized I have a very unique skillset – I understand technology and I can code, but I also understand business, marketing, and how to get shit done.  

I walk that line between “tech guy” and “business guy.” And that is something I am awesome at.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A few days ago, I was working with <a href="http://soentrepreneurial.com/" title="So Entrepreneurial by Nick Hughes">Nick Hughes</a> planning out the next <a href="http://soentrepreneurial.com/2011/08/11/food-drink-and-tech-the-seattle-startup-crawl-is-friday-august-26th-starting-at-5pm/" title="Seattle Startup Crawl">Seattle Startup Crawl</a>. One common bit of feedback about the last event was that the four locations were way too spread out (Queen Anne to Pioneer Square to Downtown to Cap Hill...), so we wanted to find four startups who wanted to participate, but were all pretty close to each other. 

Seattle2.0 has an awesome <a href="http://www.seattle20.com/startup-index.aspx" title="Seattle Startups">list of Seattle based startups</a>, but there's no addresses or location data associated with them. 

So last night I wrote a quick google apps script to scrape the Seattle20 Startup Index, run all the companies through <a href="http://switchboard.com" title="Address Reverse Lookup Service">Switchboard.com</a>, and then export them to a Google map. 

And here is the final product!

<p><iframe src="http://batchgeo.com/map/5b141fa59e30b20e6dbcbddc03d16b5e" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="550" style="border:1px solid #aaa;border-radius:10px;"></iframe></p><p><small>View <a href="http://batchgeo.com/map/5b141fa59e30b20e6dbcbddc03d16b5e">Seattle Startup Map</a> in a full screen map</small></p>

A few interesting things to note. Of the 476 startups in the Index, Switchboard was only able to find addresses for 155 of them. Of the remaining 321 startups, some don't exist anymore, and some just didn't come up in Switchboard (For example, I know the Cheezburger Network exists, and I know their address, but Switchboard couldn't find it). 

So this isn't an exhaustive map, but it's still interesting to see. If you want your startup added to the map, fill out this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?formkey=dFo5OFkyTlJISXBGbFpvejRwVk96aVE6MQ" title="Seattle Startup Map Submission Form">Seattle Startup Map Submission Form</a> and I'll add you.
