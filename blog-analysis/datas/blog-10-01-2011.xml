      Show image as background to text. You can't really calculate the width
      reliably in JS because margins are not taken into account by any of
      clientWidth, offsetWidth or scrollWidth, so we don't force a minimum
      width if the user is using shrink to fit.
      This results in a margin-width's worth of pixels being cropped. If the
      user is not using shrink to fit then we expand the header.

When you're in trouble, who do you call for help? = &lt;b&gt;Rachel Powell, probably.  Unless something absolutely must be done, regardless of ethical concerns.  Then I call my mother.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; "&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 11px; white-space: pre-wrap;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; "&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 11px; white-space: pre-wrap;"&gt;14. How did you get your name? = &lt;b&gt;I was named after my grandfather and my great-grandfather.

He started as a dark presence in the back of the tavern the FFRPG started in, and I designed his character throughout the first chapter.  I was a rather prominent architect of the original adventure, and Rel’s story plays into that quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;Let’s start explaining his background:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;There are Gods and Goddesses in this world – and their servants, the angels.  Have you ever wondered why the gods almost never intervene directly?  Why they use champions or hurl bolts from afar? …Or use angels?  It is because the gods are too pure for this world.  Even just to interact with mortals at all, they must assume identities and create personalities to wear – this is how they exist at all: a divinity is formless until an identity is assumed.  There is much speculation on why gods and goddesses have the identities they do, and it is widely accepted that it is the belief of mortals that shapes divinity into gods and goddesses.  Further speculation exists on what happens if those who believe in a god have their views start to vary… it could cause the god to become formless again, or to some degree of such, furthering it from interaction in the world.  So what of the angels? Angels are the servants of the gods on and off this world – they exist to a much more direct extent than the Gods, yet can interact directly with them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;Angels are divine.  To create an angel, a god or goddess pulls from the formless energy of divinity some power and shapes it into a being.  But it is well known that angels have little or no personality: how then do they stay in existence, much less in the material world?  It is because angels have flaws.  Every angel has a flaw that keeps it from slipping off the world – the gods use this instead of personality to avoid the dangers of egotism.  Thus are angels made, lesser divine beings under the will of the gods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;Relenor was created an angel, eons before this story began.  He was created of the Umbris line of angels, designed for a particular purpose – combat.  It is the Umbris that protect the gods from those who would rival their power.  It is the Umbris that combat the enemies of the gods.  And Umbris are angels.  In addition to the powers that stem from their divinity, Umbris have the power to drain foes of energy and strength – they are natural conduits for power, magical or otherwise.  But unlike most angels, the slight flaws that most angels have are not enough for the Umbris. Umbris have major flaws, or numerous ones: this gives them a firm anchoring in reality.  Rel’s flaw was an abhorrence, verging on complete antipathy, to the act and practice of reading minds.  Down to his core, the mind is sacrosanct to him and he will not touch it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;Relenor is the fourth angel of the Umbris line, created when the powers of the mortals first began to threaten the gods.  Mighty were his powers, and all foes fell before him for hundreds of thousands of years.  Then he was sent against a wizard that held power over time itself.  The wizard was not the most powerful foe that Relenor had faced, but the man evaded Rel time and time again – despite the face that Rel traveled through time to combat this foe, he never knew when his foe had disappeared to.  He could have read the wizard’s mind to know the destination, but that was against his very nature.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;Rel slunk home in defeat.  He was faced with a task that was beyond his ability, and for the first time had to question why he had failed.  Those were the first conscious thoughts of Relenor. He realized that the only way to defeat the wizard was to read the wizard’s mind – and that was unacceptable.  The solution to his inability was to have another Umbris take his place, but Rel had already thought once… so he thought again, and found that the only way that the other angel could win was by reading the wizard’s mind – and that was unacceptable.  He searched and searched for a solution, but everything came back to the wizard’s mind being violated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;Rel asked of the gods what he should do, and they had no answer.  Instead, the cast him down upon the world and sent another angel to defeat the wizard.  Cast down on to the world, Relenor tasted the bitterness of mortality, and the betrayal of the gods having stripped him of his powers.  Why, he wondered, and he found the god’s motive.  Rel knew in his heart that casting him down had been the right action, for he would have revolted against the gods if another angel was sent to read the wizard’s mind and to thereby defeat him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;But Rel turned from the light, and banished his heart.  He forgot who he was then, and wandered into the nearest town starving and cold – unused to the sting of mortality, he almost died.  When he awoke the next day, Relenor the man was born.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;Rel was now a mortal, but the imprint of his former powers still lay upon him.  He was a natural conduit for energy, magical or otherwise, though he could not cast magic himself.  He was more innocent that those naturally of the world, though that trait soon vanished.  His body did not age, though over the years he became wiser in the ways of the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;And he had known power, and he craved for it again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;After setting himself up, he became a student at a school of warriors.  More motivated then the rest, he rose to the top of his class - eventually becoming greater than the teacher himself.  Rel’s body rose to the challenge, and a preternatural strength and speed soon became apparent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;Soon he left, seeking more power than the school had managed to provide.  As he explored the world for whatever would give him power, he began to remember his past.  His self-induced amnesia started to fade, and he began to wonder what his past was.  What had he been?  The answers were not clear.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;Soon he chanced upon a rumor that would change his life.  A sickly dragon was said to live in a mountain nearby, and Rel jumped at the chance of what the horde must contain.  He searched out the entrance of the dragon’s lair, and entered it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;The dragon was waiting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;It turned out that the rumors had been false – the dragon was not weak in the least, and rather was more powerful than the greatest of its kind.  Rel knew he was unable to win, but charged anyway, hoping his legacy would be to scratch one iridescent crimson scale.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;The dragon off-handedly swatted him into a wall before he could sprint far enough to reach the dragon’s body.  Surprised that he had survived the impact, the dragon waited for Rel to awaken… perhaps there was a use for him…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;The pain of defeat brought back more memories, and Rel realized that he had once been an angel, leveler of the mighty.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;“Thou art a mighty man,” the Dragon spoke “I deem you worthy of some lesser duties.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;“I am no man,” spoke Relenor “I am a fallen angel.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;“My pardon, former guardian of the light.” The Dragon spoke again, “Perhaps a high station and bestowed power should be yours…”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;Rel, hungry for the power that the mighty Wrym could bestow, pledged his loyalty to the Dragon. They mixed blood, and the Dragon proclaimed Rel its champion, gifting him with extreme amounts of power.  The dragon knew of the Umbris, and rightly assumed she would be a target if she used her power directly.  There was also a prophecy that proclaimed that an elven champion would slay her – she suspected that Rel, not being born of this world—and not being accounted for in the act of prophecy—was a factor of randomness that could disrupt the prophecy.  Rel, in return for the power she gave him, used his knowledge to hide the Dragon from the angels’ watchful eyes, and created a plan to make her a goddess.  Unfortunately, this involved having people openly worship her to give her divinity.  Throughout, there was a growing sense that he had drifted farther and farther from his origins, betraying his former masters by plotting for the dragon to succeed in what he had been created to stop.  He also because disillusioned with what the dragon asked him to do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;A mere 63 years after making the blood pact with the Dragon, Relenor betrayed her.  He never returned from a mission.  Instead, he wandered the lands far from the dragon’s lair.  A few days after he was supposed to return, he decided to see what he still retained from the infused power of the dragon.  Finding a boulder in a forest, he punched it with all his strength, testing how much he had.  His punch shattered the boulder into a thousand pieces and sent the shards ripping through the forest, devastating a hillside.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;Rel was amazed – he had assumed that the Dragon wouldn’t leave him such power.  Then the dragon’s intent became apparent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;Rel watched in horror and pain as the Dragon withdrew her support.  The flesh of his arm turned to a bloody pulp and the bones underneath shattered – the muscles that had powered the mighty punch ripped and tore. Rel screamed then, for though he had suffered worse as an angel, this pain was beyond his bounds as a mortal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;Rel hobbled back to the town he was staying at, and found a healer for his mutilated arm. Despite their magics, and his natural sensitivity to such forces, his arm still took a week to become usable again.  Rel swore never to do something as foolish again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;Once his body had healed, he continued practicing his art as a swordman.  He adopted a runaway orphan as an apprentice, and trained her in swordplay.  But it was increasingly obvious that the Dragon was sapping his body of strength, empowering him when he exercised, so he could not built natural muscle, but sapping him the rest of the time.  He continued teaching his apprentice, showing how to weave blades and magic like he had once done, and imparting wisdom upon her.  But he found that she was impossible to guide, for she believed in vengeance.  He told her that it was not right, and later that she should go and find wisdom before he would train her more.  Neither worked, for she did not believe him, nor wished to leave.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;So Relenor left.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;He decided that it was time to free himself from the dragon’s curse.  He left the girl, and traveled to an old friend - the guild master of the thieves’ guild.  There he conversed over how to kill the Dragon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;A plan was made.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;Relenor would return to the Dragon and work in its service, procuring a weapon from the dragon’s hoard that could kill the Dragon.  Relenor remembered stealing several weapons for the Dragon – She could not wield them, and they were not given Relenor to use; between that and their highly magical nature, Rel guessed that the dragon viewed them as a risk.  But Rel couldn’t fight the Dragon directly, weakened as he was.  Neither could any of the guild master’s underlings, for the Dragon was ever aware of anything of magical nature nearby.  It would have to be an attack that the dragon saw coming.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;The guild master recommended an elven mercenary who was greatly skilled in the blade.  Yet Rel doubted in her, for he was once skilled as well, and had never managed to touch the beast – what good was a weapon if you died before using it?  And so he plotted a deeper plot…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in"&gt;That takes you up to the beginning of the FFRPG.  I might write up some of Relenor’s schemes later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7161322563694424329-2097213212899259732?l=whatsupnil.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/feeds/2097213212899259732/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2011/05/relenor.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/2097213212899259732'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/2097213212899259732'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2011/05/relenor.html' title='Relenor'/><author><name>Nil Athelion</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16996018952758178741</uri><email>featherless@gmail.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7161322563694424329.post-6923149287250117029</id><published>2011-03-25T01:48:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2011-03-25T01:48:53.613-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Dwarf Fortress'/><title type='text'>The Demise of Dikeorgan (Dwarf Fortress)</title><content type='html'>&lt;div&gt;It started with a water problem, ironically.  I was experimenting with a pump and a waterwheel where my fortress met the stream.  This would have been fine, except when nobody seemed to do anything about the mechanisms I had ordered, I turned the area into a walled and roofed fishing area.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;However, after I had walled it shut to the outside and opened it up to the interior of my fortress, someone finally got around to building the pump.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Turns out that pumps don't come with off switches.  They just pump water.  A lot of it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I tell folks to go take appart the pump, but it's pumping water like crazy, and nobody can push up against the flow - I keep seeing dwarves run towards it, then go back and forth with the flow.  One guy drowns.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I then take a different route - I order miners to mine away the wall on the outside, so that the pump empties water to the outside, not to the inside.  Well, empties both ways, but it cut down on pressure.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So miners dig a bunch of holes, and water starts coming out.  Finally some mason struggles through the water and takes appart the water wheel.  The water ceases, not much damage.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;...and then the dragon Akera Thasacaci Rano Inira shows up.  Gets anounced on the map and everything.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Oh dear.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I suddenly realize that there is a massive hole in my defenses - my store rooms are open on the lower hillside, completely defenseless.  I quickly order dwarves to seal it up.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Those dwarves get cooked.  Akera kills a few other dwarves running around the map, and I try to close the breach again.  If I can just seal off the interior, I can be safe-ish.  For a time, anyway.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Big gouts of fire.  Masons get cooked.  Akera enters into my storeroom, sets things on fire.  Smoke is everywhere, and I have a non-stop stream of messages saying that tasks have been cancelled due to "dragon" and that dwarves are dying.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Everyone is running around in a panic, and they are dying.  Before I know it, my population is down to 30-something.  30-something is less than 77.  A lot less.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I order everyone to stand outside, to lure Akera past the entrance-way traps, going the other way.  Maybe she will get caught in a cage trap, or maybe she's at least get injured by my many weapon traps.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Meanwhile, Akera roasts dwarves, workshops, food, stockpiles, farms, and anything that is flammable or inflammable.  Smoke is everywhere, I cannot see where Akera is rampaging.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Eventually, I see her in the big room that was supposed to be the new textile industry center.  The one that has two doors and a stairway out.  I delete the burrow so my dwarves can move freely, and get someone to close the door.  Said person dies horribly to smoke inhalation, heat, or something.  Other folks go to wall in the upstairs farm.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Akera kills the rest of the masons, and goes from the upstairs farm to the pasture, and down some stairs into the main fort again.  Slaughters everyone there.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I order everyone back to outside the door, huddling behind the traps.  There are now 17 dwarves left.  They start a fist-fight.  Specifically, half of them go into tantrum mode.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Akera sits out the eastern staircase, just around the corner from the fist-fight.  She is not moving.  Corpse are starting to decay, and everyone is alternating between calming down, and tantruming over their favorite friend starting to rot.  Some guy dies.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Akera rounds the corner and obliterates the dwarf who had stopped halfway with broken legs.  She then wanders back around the corner.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;One of the dwarves is killed by another.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Akera notices one of the dwarves down below go by the eastern staircase.  She pops down below and incinerates most of the room with a fire-blast.  She then returns to her roost.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Somehow three of my dwarves are still estatic.  They are being beaten up by the miserable ones.  Somehow an insane dwarf gets past Akera's roost and joins the others.  Joining them with her fists.  I see items go flying around the area they all are hiding.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ber Berdegel, Dwarven Child goes berserk.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I set a new burrow to the other side or the river, hoping to make a home there away from the death and destruction.  Some of the dwarves head over there, and Akera stays put.  However, I get the unfortunate message: "Domas Dedukestun, Miner cancels Dig: Interrupted by Dwarven Child."&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Eventually I find Domas.  He is being chased around the wilderness by a berserk child.  He has the only pickaxe, and the rest of the survivors wander around the new burrow.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Eventually he gets away from the child, but then throws a tantrum himself.  He calms down, and starts digging the tunnel to... relative safety.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Then the fisherdwarf goes berserk...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Eventually things calm down.  I also forbid every item in the old fortress.  Don't have an axe for wood, but at least I have a pick?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Turns out Dragons can smash doors.  And walls.  Can't even wall myself in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Construction on the new home goes... with lots of tantrums and upset dwarves.  I still have a fisherdwarf, so he catches lots of fish.  I have food and I have water.  Next step is sanity.  Still need an axe for beds, though&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Human Caravan arrives.  Heads to the depo.  Somehow they get past Akera, who is one room away.  Maybe there is hope.  Stupid, stupid hope.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Rimtar the Bone Carver goes insane and is struck down by the miner.  I unforbid a few beds and a table and a chair.  Perhaps I can sneak in the same way Akera go in - she's on a different level, after all.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;...and then goblins show up.  They finish what Akera did not - they go to the new hole and kill everyone there.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;There is one dwarf left.  He was trapped in the dwarven catacombs when the dragon first arrived.  He is dying of starvation and thirst.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Remember!  Losing is fun!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7161322563694424329-6923149287250117029?l=whatsupnil.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/feeds/6923149287250117029/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2011/03/demise-of-dikeorgan-dwarf-fortress.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/6923149287250117029'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/6923149287250117029'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2011/03/demise-of-dikeorgan-dwarf-fortress.html' title='The Demise of Dikeorgan (Dwarf Fortress)'/><author><name>Nil Athelion</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16996018952758178741</uri><email>featherless@gmail.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7161322563694424329.post-4162162003771699298</id><published>2011-03-15T23:16:00.004-07:00</published><updated>2011-03-15T23:24:56.948-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='MTG'/><title type='text'>Thoughts on MTG Deckbuilding, and What I Like</title><content type='html'>&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: arial; font-size: small; "&gt;&lt;div&gt;For me a beautiful deck is a deck that interacts with others, protects itself as it needs to, has the offense that it needs to, etc. all in perfect balance and harmony.  Thus a deck that has great offense, but is fragile isn't my ideal; a deck that is solid, but can't do anything isn't my ideal; a deck that does one thing and then uses some completely different method to be good at something else is disharmonious and isn't my ideal.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But it's never the deck itself that is beautiful.  It's the play of the deck.  I measure and value decks in terms of what they will do, and the art is in the doing.  The most beautiful game for me is one where both decks are preforming plays and counterplays, each one just barely having the answer to the problems posed by the other until someone slips.  But I strive for what happens in the mean time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I play a red deck against a big, nice midrange deck.  I attack with my creatures, and they encounter spot removal, a counter to my creatures that keeps them weaker while the opponent builds up his mana.  That, and my decks responses to sacrifice creatures to deny him lifegain or burn him one little bit more (all the mini-plays) are beautiful to me.  My deck says, "look what I can do!  I'm getting killed, but still getting stuff through!" and his deck is saying "Look what I can do, I'm lessening his creatures so I can buy time, just what my master needs!"   ... and later there is another play between the decks - the midrange deck drops its fat, and my creatures stare down a 4/4.  Strategy on the players' parts is employed - for me, should I attack into it so some guys get by for damage, or  should I wait until I find some removal, and combine the two....  But on the deck end of things, they get to show off their stuff.  I fight through for a little more damage while my creatures die against that 4/4, it is my plan.  He beats with the 4/4 as soon as he can, trying to take me out before I draw enough burn to finish him - the final act is in motion.  Will my deck show off it's goodness and provide me with the burn I need to win before the five hits take me to 0?  Will his deck counter with some life-gain kill-spell aimed at one of my creatures, now that I don't have a mechanism to sacrifice them?  The optimal would be for me to draw enough burn, but for him to counter with, say, Faith's Fetters to buy him just enough time to win.  Because then both decks would have shown off their stuff.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But all decks &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; things, right?  They all make their plays.  But for me, if one deck does something that the other deck has no counter to--and that's defined vaguely--then that's not a beautiful game.  Because all the playskill in the world won't help you if your deck doesn't have the right cards, and the deck will be sad, not having any way to provide me with the tools I need to use to fight.  And the other deck is sad, because it can't really show off it's stuff, winning in the face of adversity, it's just follows it's rote form and wins.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I guess that's the main thing, perhaps - adapting to win in the face of adversity.  My blue-white Mastermind deck can't do it's game plan against your land destruction, and so it turns to using the masterminds to protect lands and keep people busy while little guys run across and win.  That adaptation is my joy as a player, and my pride in my decks come from their ability to provide me with the tools I need to adapt when the deck loses the plot.  Which is to say that I am a bit funny as a johnny player - I want my plans to be ruined, and my fall-back plans (and ideally new ones I came up with on the spot) to be the ones that get to show their quality.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any deck can build a plan, and execute a plan... in a vacuum.  Even &lt;a href="http://nillion.livejournal.com/15961.html"&gt;WLGYLSTYESFD&lt;/a&gt; could do its thing, given the chance.  But the ability to execute a plan through adversity, or to be able to deal with adversity, that's excellence in a deck.  And I don't mean adversity as in the challenges the deck was built to resist - I mean ones different or much stronger than expected.  A deck fails when it can't adapt, and that makes me sad, and a deck doesn't succeed if it just does what it's supposed to do - that's just meeting expectations.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So play a game with me, and kill my key creatures, destroy the enchantment the deck revolves around.  Your deck has the answers, doesn't it?  Well, so does mine - watch as my deck brings back the piece from the graveyard, or converts itself into a beating machine during the lull as you found your removal, and tries to capitalize on the position it already got.  Or watch it pull together a much weaker synergy, and try to win with that.  Your deck answered my threat, but can it beat down to finish me off faster than I can finish you off?  What do you do if I play the key piece again?  Watch my deck as it tries to stall you before you beat me down - it's a race of sorts, and maybe I'll lose.  Or maybe not.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Don't let me win against you by pulling off my plan.  That's just boring.  Don't beat me by doing something to which I cannot respond.  That's just sad.  But if you struggle to do something, and I struggle to resist, then each deck gets to show off all the things it was made to do, and maybe a little more.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7161322563694424329-4162162003771699298?l=whatsupnil.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/feeds/4162162003771699298/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2011/03/thoughts-on-mtg-deckbuilding-and-what-i.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/4162162003771699298'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/4162162003771699298'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2011/03/thoughts-on-mtg-deckbuilding-and-what-i.html' title='Thoughts on MTG Deckbuilding, and What I Like'/><author><name>Nil Athelion</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16996018952758178741</uri><email>featherless@gmail.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7161322563694424329.post-1069004609796561708</id><published>2010-06-01T13:36:00.004-07:00</published><updated>2010-09-17T18:06:40.640-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Crazy Thoughts'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='So you know'/><title type='text'>The Robot Apocalypse: Pie Style</title><content type='html'>&lt;div&gt;The robot apocalypse happens like this:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Someone creates a smart robot to serve him.  Either fails to put in First Law protection, or for selfish reasons makes a zero-law of obeying him.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That someone asks the robot to make him a tasty pie.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The robot does.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The man finishes the pie, and tells the robot, "Make me more pie!"  He fatefully leaves out specification of how much pie.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The robot attempts to fulfill the command as best possible: If the robot makes as much pie as possible, then the undefined "More Pie!" has the optimal chance of being fulfilled (or a 100% chance, if the request was reasonable).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The robot figures out the limits of optimal pie creation: Pie is limited by matter/energy to form it, and by entropy to organize it into a pie.  Thus the robot is on a clock against entropy to make pie.  The robot is also in a competition against everything else that is creating entropy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The robot makes a plan: To create pie fast enough to race reasonably with entropy, some entropy must be spent to increase the speed of pie-making.  This involves other robots to make efficiently produced matter-to-pie devices.  Also robots to gather the resources.  Also robots to protect those gatherers from hostile phenomena.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The robot's first step is to quickly mobilize the entirety of the resources of the earth* to quickly mobilize the resources of the solar system to continue onwards and ultimately convert the universe into as much pie as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See that * there?  Already, the robot apocalypse has occurred, as we are converted into organizations of matter more useful for the creation of pie.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That is how the robot apocalypse happens.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Also how the universe gets turned into pie.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7161322563694424329-1069004609796561708?l=whatsupnil.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/feeds/1069004609796561708/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2010/06/robot-apocalypse-pie-style.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/1069004609796561708'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/1069004609796561708'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2010/06/robot-apocalypse-pie-style.html' title='The Robot Apocalypse: Pie Style'/><author><name>Nil Athelion</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16996018952758178741</uri><email>featherless@gmail.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7161322563694424329.post-819051709937091088</id><published>2010-05-16T13:19:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2010-05-16T13:20:34.898-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Graduation</title><content type='html'>By the way, I graduated from ASU and "Barrett, the Honors College at ASU" magna cum laude on the 13th of May, 2010.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7161322563694424329-819051709937091088?l=whatsupnil.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/feeds/819051709937091088/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2010/05/graduation.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/819051709937091088'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/819051709937091088'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2010/05/graduation.html' title='Graduation'/><author><name>Nil Athelion</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16996018952758178741</uri><email>featherless@gmail.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7161322563694424329.post-4701489282535141083</id><published>2010-02-23T13:01:00.003-07:00</published><updated>2010-02-23T13:40:40.059-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game characters'/><title type='text'>Maehadros</title><content type='html'>Maehadros was the first DnD character I created, and I built him with what I thought was a relatively interesting backstory.  He was a human fighter, probably the most generic option I could have built mechanically.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Backstory:&lt;/i&gt; Maehadros was the son of a nobleman in one of the city-states of a particular unnamed continent.  His father wanted him to apprentice to become a cleric, but Maehadros rebelled and ran off to a different city-state, and enlisted in the city guard there.  Eventually the city he was working for came into conflict with his hometown, and Maehadros deserted the town guard.  He found work as a mercenary, and was hired by what turned out to be a pro-human organization.  While he didn't agree with their pro-human sentiments, he considered it a job, and helped them anyway.  Eventually he became aware that they were a fairly radical cult, but continued to work for them until they gave him orders to kill the children of some local dwarves they had lynched.  He then abandoned his job and fled on a ship away from the continent to avoid repercussions with the cult.  This is how he wound up on the ship with the other Player Characters.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Character traits:&lt;/i&gt; The essence of Maehadros, or Mae, as he is generally known, is that he is a good person at heart, but lacks the courage to follow his heart.  Instead he follows orders over his own judgement.  By this point in his life, he is fully aware of the painful repercussions of not standing up for what he believes in, but has not implemented that in his life.  Instead, he still follows the moral judgement of his new commanding officer (Tucker's warlord).  His opinions mostly go in his journal, as always.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Other traits of the character include a town-guard sense of ethics, rather than the sense of an adventurer.  He would rather bring his defeated foes to justice than to kill them, even if (as pointed out by other characters) bringing them to justice would doubtlessly lead to their execution.  Again, he looks to authority other than his own, rather than making judgments on the lives of the defeated.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Character growth:&lt;/i&gt; Maehadros never had much opportunity to act upon his beliefs, partly due to me, the player, being pressured into not... complicating things.  The party goes places, it kills things, it gets experience and loot, and I apparently wasn't supposed to call into question the ethics of all the things we were doing, let alone rebel against the judgement of the other players.  Maehadros himself suffered a good deal of bullying by other players, mostly in terms of who was leading the party in the absence of Tucker and his character.  (I was also somewhat disappointed to find that most of the party was neutral, and the paladin was of the "I'm a paladin, this gives me justification to kill things," style.)  This was all cut short by Mae's untimely death.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Analysis:&lt;/i&gt;  Maehadros deals with a lot of questions I have concerning righteous action, authority, and the subjectivity of morality, I suppose?  And of social pressures?  Dunno.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7161322563694424329-4701489282535141083?l=whatsupnil.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/feeds/4701489282535141083/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2010/02/maehadros.html#comment-form' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/4701489282535141083'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/4701489282535141083'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2010/02/maehadros.html' title='Maehadros'/><author><name>Nil Athelion</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16996018952758178741</uri><email>featherless@gmail.com</email></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7161322563694424329.post-546628880913076856</id><published>2010-02-23T12:52:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2010-02-23T13:44:27.079-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game characters'/><title type='text'>Dnd Characters - what does this say about me?</title><content type='html'>A good deal of people think that when a writer creates a character, they invest something of themselves into the character.

We were talking about the 9/11 attacks today (WTC towers, Pentagon, and another airplane crash), and i was reminded how terrorism chose the timing of the 9/11 attacks.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;See, they wanted symbolic targets - the Pentagon, and the WTC towers count, as does Washington DC (the probable target of the plane that crashed in Pennsylvania).  But they weren't seeking to kill people, directly.  In fact, they chose the time of attack with the greatest proportion of symbolic damage to the amount of deaths: The early morning.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;See, both the pentagon and the WTC weren't exactly filled up, as they would have been a mere 3 or 4 hours later.  The later in the day, the higher the casualties.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So why not do it at night, when people wouldn't be killed?  After all, if you want a lower death count, then that would be best.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That's where media impact and the message that they were trying to send comes in.  If you attacked when it was dark, then none of those powerful, scarring images of the WTC towers burning would have been able to be seen.  Al-Quada didn't know the towers would fall (Osama was the most optimistic in positing that the tops might fall off), so the lasting damage would be limited to nasty, fire-gutted holes in the tops of the towers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So daylight so that the American people can see what they did, and yet morning to avoid unnecessary deaths.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7161322563694424329-1793380020721253415?l=whatsupnil.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/feeds/1793380020721253415/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2010/02/thoughts-on-media-and-911.html#comment-form' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/1793380020721253415'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/1793380020721253415'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2010/02/thoughts-on-media-and-911.html' title='Thoughts on Media and 9/11'/><author><name>Nil Athelion</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16996018952758178741</uri><email>featherless@gmail.com</email></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7161322563694424329.post-5644619633099219661</id><published>2010-01-04T17:49:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2010-01-04T17:54:43.823-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Diarrhea</title><content type='html'>Somewhat disgusting, as might be guessed by the title:&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I find myself morbidly amused by the splatter patterns in the toilet bowls.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That's all.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7161322563694424329-5644619633099219661?l=whatsupnil.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/feeds/5644619633099219661/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2010/01/diarrhea.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/5644619633099219661'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/5644619633099219661'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2010/01/diarrhea.html' title='Diarrhea'/><author><name>Nil Athelion</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16996018952758178741</uri><email>featherless@gmail.com</email></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7161322563694424329.post-8846254956676751123</id><published>2009-12-29T20:21:00.007-07:00</published><updated>2011-05-15T11:03:08.928-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game Design'/><title type='text'>Fluxx</title><content type='html'>&lt;div&gt;[[Edit: This has been done before, unsuprisingly.]]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Hey, couldn't we make a game of super-fluxx with some note-cards?&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Pure Fluxx&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Players: Three+&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Materials: A lot of identical note-cards.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Rules: At the beginning of each turn, the active player draws a card or writes up a card.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(Writing a card has to be approved by at the majority of other players, and puts it into their hand.

Individual and universal&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hand: A zone for each player.  Any card in a hand is naturally only viewed by the player.  The starting rules also have the active player play a card from his hand.  Cards are "in hand"&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Active: These are the rules, objects, etc., that are in play, and affect all players equally.  They are placed in the middle between the players, and can be seen by all players. Cards are "active".&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Control: These are the cards that, while active, have special effects relative to their "controller."  While on the table and visible to all, they are put directly in front of a player.  Cards are "under the control of [player name]"&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Library: These are the cards that are hidden from all players in a face-down pile of cards somewhere reachable on the table.  The committing the action "Draw a card" refers to putting the top card of the library into your hand without revealing it to everyone else.  If someone tries to draw a card when the library is empty, the Recycle Bin is shuffled, and turned into the library.  If the recycle bin is also empty, then the player writes up a new card instead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Recycle bin: These are the cards that have been contradicted by other cards, or otherwise inactive.  They are piled face-up, revealed to all players, somewhere not to be confused with the active cards.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;--&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Card types:  These are different sorts of cards, and are handled differently, mechanically. Main types and sub-types.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Static: Maintype.  Rules, and other cards that stay in play.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;One-time: Maintype. Cards that have an effect, then leave play.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Responsive: Static or one-time cards that may be played whenever the conditions on them are true.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Goal: Cards that allow a player or players to win.

Both of those were great, so I decided to pick up another before heading off to Malaysia and Indonesia.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Similar to the other two books, the plot is convoluted and suspenseful, making full utilization of the hard-he-can-manage sci-fi concepts existing in Alastair's world.  The Prefect is interesting, exciting, and somewhat gut-wrenching at times (I'm looking at you, Jane).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Prefect&lt;/i&gt; is also escapes on of the most common problems with science fiction: Explaining things.  (Fantasy can have this problem if the writer feels like it.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You see, most characters who grew up in a world generally manage to have it make sense to them.  Since we don't live in that world, things don't make sense to us.  Therefore, some authors feel they should explain everything.  This can be explaining everything, be Explaining Everything, or be EXPLAINING EVERYTHING.  However, taking time to explain things causes problem for any sort of narrative: Short essays embedded in the story cause problems.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;On the other side, hand-waving everything would really just be fantasy, not science-fiction.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Reynold tends towards giving a name and maybe a short summary, but then having his explanation only exist in what's relevant to the characters, what the characters think about, and what happens.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;He also manages to steer clear of anything that expressedly violates the laws of physics, or at least only violate them on a scale that the technology of the setting would be able to reasonably circumvent them.  Additionally, and just as important, everything has a relatively sensible and utilitarian design.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Which brings me to the setting.  Alastair uses a single setting--Revelation Space--for his novels, and it is pretty darn complex.  It's future history, starting in the foreseeable future (far enough to avoid &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn"&gt;science marching on&lt;/a&gt;, and continuing through the imaginable future to the end of the future (Stinking Greenfly...).  Unlike the previous two books I read, The Prefect is set in the height of human civilization, on the hub of human civilization, on the orbital habitats utilized by the elite of society.  This means that things get very, very exotic, especially due to the freedom loving nature of demarchist rule.  Very interesting things are encounters.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I think I'm degressing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The plot is complicated, but strong, and I approve.  The characters are varied and interesting, and I approve*.  The setting is gorgeous and well-thought, and I approve.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Really, I approve of the book all around.  Very good for those folks who like sci-fi novels that avoid sacrificing being a novel for being sci-fi.  Still good for everyone else.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;*: The titular Prefect, Tom Dreyfus** is a bit of a canon sue.  He is, as referenced by the characters in the story, pretty much the perfect Prefect.  Not perfect in always victorious, or hopelessly overpowered, but perfect in a flawless-action sort of way.  They do what they can while they can.  However, I managed to completely overlook this until some stuff in the story went horribly wrong for the protagonists, and I saw the other characters taking the lead and messing up.  When things got better (this is a highly relative term), I was too filled with satisfaction to care.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;**: I could help but notice the last name from my historical knowledge.  Seems unlikely that he would wind up with the same name.  Demerits for contrived naming.  On the other hand, it works well.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7161322563694424329-1997723013137762341?l=whatsupnil.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/feeds/1997723013137762341/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2009/12/prefect.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/1997723013137762341'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/1997723013137762341'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2009/12/prefect.html' title='The Prefect'/><author><name>Nil Athelion</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16996018952758178741</uri><email>featherless@gmail.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7161322563694424329.post-4961639195347422830</id><published>2009-10-28T20:24:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2009-10-28T23:52:33.273-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Empowered</title><content type='html'>I recently had the opportunity to read &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empowered"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Empowered&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was not only surprisingly good, but better than I thought (I had heard good things about it).  What I expected was, as TvTropes puts it, a "graphic novel series  starring a Damsel in Distress-prone heroine named 'Empowered.' Contains heavy deconstruction of the Super Hero genre, with healthy doses of bondage, Fanservice, and comedy."&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What I found was... well pretty much what the above says.  The fanservice was a bit too pronounced for my taste, and Emp getting trussed up a lot early on wasn't all that sexy because... well, onto the unexpected.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The characters are great.  While they all run off of assorted superhero sterotypes, all of them have unique, interesting, strong personalities.  Some of them I sympathize with, and root for (Empowered, Ninjette, etc.).  Some of them I look up to in awe and admiration (Mindf**k, Maid Man, etc.). Some of them I want to club with a hammer... repeatedly (Captain Havok, most of the jerkass supers, and sometimes Sista Spooky).  One of them is terrifying and wrong and scary (and doesn't play by the rules).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is why Emp getting tied up isn't all that sexy.  She might be an idealistically beautiful woman wearing (well-placed) tatters of a skin-adhering body-suit, but it's hard to enjoy the fanservicey nature of her predicament when you care for Emp so much.  Thus stripperific bondage =/= sexy.  Instead stripperific bondage = feeling sorry for Emp.  She's far too sympathetic and complex a character to objectify.  Well, I'd rather not objectify her, anyway.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Anyway, concerning the characters, it is important to note that they are not one-sided.  Aside from Captain Havok, who enjoys my vehement and eternal contempt, most of the other nasty characters have their own internal problems, and are just expressing them worse than the nicer characters, with their own emotional problems flaws.  I can only think of a few characters who are simple, but I would not complain about their purity of essence (Go Maid Man!).  Even the minions are hard to objectify.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Which brings me to the next point - the story of the novels doesn't really pertain that much to the actual action.  Instead, most of the story deals with characters' feelings.  Think Neon Genesis Evangelion, but without the constantly feeling horrible bit.  Often the battles are skipped, with Empowered assumably losing and getting captured, and instead there is the emotional abuse from other characters, interaction with and responses from friends, etc.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;With that in mind, the story is really about Empowered's personal growth... and boy is there a lot of it.  Empowered starts out with freshly shattered dreams to go with a shattered self-esteem, and from there she struggles upwards, with the help of her friends.  This is all managed well, with an exception to be noted later.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Empowered&lt;/i&gt; also has heavy, heavy &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome"&gt;Cerebus Syndrome&lt;/a&gt;.  The first three volumes are fairly comedic, but then the fourth one has heavy drama, and by the end of the fifth one I was outright crying.  A well-done romance has something to do with that.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Empowered&lt;/i&gt; also gets better.  If I had just read the first volume, I would have thought &lt;i&gt;Empowered&lt;/i&gt; was pretty decent for what it does, and leave it at that.  Fortunately, I had a healthy list of recommendation, and I pushed onward.  By the second volume, I was starting to enjoy the tale, and by the third I approved heartily.  But the fourth and fifth volumes are why I'm spieling about it.  I don't go and write here about just any little comic, you know.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Other things to note:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Mindf**k and Maid Man are new role models for me.  Mindf**k gets to hang out with Nausicaa and other characters who influenced my development.  Maid Man is an all around good guy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The setting is fairly interesting, in and of itself.  There are Unwritten Rules to behavior, so nothing truly bad happens to Empowered (breaking the unwritten rules by, say, unnecessarily sexually molesting Emp would bring down the wrath of every superhero, which is a decent deterent  same with killing her.).  The whole way the world is adjusted to the existence of superheroes is rather interesting.  A lot of characters, especially the unpowered ones and minions have interesting takes on the superheros and villains.  There are a lot of little tidbits about how the world works, that are quite interesting.  Emp finds out that all three superheros she is working with all became superheros after contracting super-natural STDs - she finds this coincidence weird, and then finds out that they first met at a super-natural STD support group.  Some of the characters previously posed as Witless Minions, manipulating the system to steal their employer's valuables and blame it on the heroes.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Also interesting is the effect when certain characters break the Unwritten Rules.  It's... impressive.  And horrific.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I do have issue with a few things, though.  Emp's boyfriend is perhaps not the best role model for building self-esteem.  While he's a fine guy otherwise, in terms of boyfriendness... he deals with Emp's low self-esteem in a (fanservice-y) way I do not approve of (I'm much more part of the Mindf**k school of romance).  Also related is his unrealistic sex with Emp - he apparently follows the hentai school of sex.  I suppose part of this is that I gave up on the pornographic aspect of the series, and consequently find the carefully-placed speech bubbles more amusing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Going on from there, I love the Caged Demonwolf's imagined rendition of Emp's sex with her boyfriend.  Which one of the other characters uses for smut, apparently.   Heck, the fact that Emp still reads yaoi superhero slash fanfiction (occasionally even starring her teammates) amuses me to no end.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Also, both Emp and her boyfriend are ridiculously/idealistically physically attractive.  While the power of body-image issues are profound, I always find Emp's problems a bit strange.  That said, they do live in a world where nearly everyone manages a ideal body-shape, with few exceptions, so I suppose it's not that strange?  Dunno.  I understand why Emp is a Hot Blonde, comercially speaking, and I can see Spookum's problem with her.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Anyway, it is a good series, assuming you are okay with &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandOrObjectUnderwear"&gt;everything&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodivaHair"&gt;short&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeekABoo"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CensorSteam"&gt;nudity&lt;/a&gt; and occasional  objectifying shots.

She needed to write a critical analysis of a play, and I thought it would be nice to go out with her to a play.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So.  Play.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The play's name is "The Shape of Things."  From here on out there are massive spoilers that pretty much ruin the play, so if you plan on seeing it, go see it.  It's pretty good.  And stop reading here.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The play starts out with a young lady stepping over the cord to get closer to a statue.  The security guard asks there to step back over, and they have a conversation.  She's apparently planning on spray-painting a penis on the statue, as the original penis was plastered over with fig leaves, due to complaints about the nudity.  She's an art student.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;He doesn't really try to stop her, and gets her phone number, and when his shift is up, he heads off and she presumably spraypaints on the statue.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;They get together, and start dating.  He starts losing weight for her, changes his hair.  Two friends of his are introduced, another young lady and her fiancee, said fiancee being the guy's former roommate and best bud.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Over time, he changes more - stops biting his nails, starts wearing contact lenses instead of glasses, dresses differently, and has his nose modified.  He keeps a diary of this all - the decreasing weight, and all various changes.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;His best bud's fiancee has had a long-time crush on him, and with him getting cuter by the day, she winds up kissing him and going out to the woods (and then implied sex, apparently).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The young lady confesses kissing him to her fiancee, who talks with the guy's girlfriend, who kisses said fiancee to get back at the other two.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;She brings up all of this when the young lady, herself, and the guy go get coffee at a Starbucks together.  The young lady goes away almost in tears, and the guy is mad at her.  He doesn't want to break up with her, and asks what she wants.  She asks him to break all contact with them, giving them no explanation, if he wants to stay with her like he says.  He agrees.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The next scene is them at the thesis presentation for the artist girl.  The guy runs into his former best bud, and the other girl, who have broken up by this point.  They all sit separately.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Artist girl goes to present her thesis work, and it turns out her presentation, her "sculpture thingie" as she previously referred to it, is her boyfriend, who has proposed to her by this point.  She has sculpted him from being pathetic and undesirable into being much "better" by society's standards, using the tools of persuasion and desire, though always leaving the choice up to him.  She has improved him cosmetically, and modified all of his relationships.  Her entire relationship with him over the semester was all a lie to sculpt him into a different person.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;He is outraged, and comes to her after the presentation, and they have an argument over the morality of her actions.  To her, everything he did was his own choice - he had chosen to lose weight, he had chosen to abandon his friends for her.  To him, he thought that she was completely and horribly unethical, in the deceit of the relationship.  But in her eyes, the relationship was real - for him.  And the choices he had made, he had made honestly, though perhaps a bit misinformed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;He asks of anything was true, and she says that none of it was true.  As she leaves, she tells him that one time, while they were sleeping together, one of the things she had said was true (they both know, though the audience doesn't).  He goes to the videos of them in bed (part of the exhibition), and finds the part, playing it over and over, biting his nails and munching on the cookies provided at the exhibit, crying as the lights dim and the play ends.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A number of things concerning this.  First, the lady considers what she is doing as amoral.  Not moral, not immoral, but rather because she was doing art, the normal rules don't apply.  Adam, the guy, when he finds out, finds it morally abhorrent.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Second, the question of subjectivity.  It's mentioned quite a bit in the play, and comes up quite large in the conclusion, as the art lady and the guy have been living very different versions of life, and have very different views on things.  Was his relationship true?  - It certainly had effects on his life.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Third, there is a question of value - what is better, and what is worse, and how it matters.  the art lady is apparently quite aware how subjective her changes for the "better" are.  But, as she notes rather bitterly during the presentation, as he became better-looking and more self-confident, he also started having more questionable behavior.  Getting it on with his best friend's fiancee being a major case in point here.  Additionally, at the end of the play, the main character says that he liked who he was, even if he wasn't as "good" then as now.  His friend, somewhat earlier in the play, remarks on how his friend is acting more like him, and how the ying-yang of the two doesn't work anymore - he liked the guy for being wildly different from himself.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This provoked interesting conversations after the play, of course, but that's for a different time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I found it very good, provoking me both emotionally and intellectually.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7161322563694424329-368613685664147809?l=whatsupnil.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/feeds/368613685664147809/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2009/09/shape-of-things_19.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/368613685664147809'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/368613685664147809'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2009/09/shape-of-things_19.html' title='The Shape of Things'/><author><name>Nil Athelion</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16996018952758178741</uri><email>featherless@gmail.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7161322563694424329.post-8607618754742119699</id><published>2009-09-03T21:08:00.003-07:00</published><updated>2009-09-03T21:37:44.876-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>The government probably isn't listening to your cellphone.</title><content type='html'>So I recently (in my informatics class) ran across the amount of data that was sent via cell-phones last year (2008).

I recommend it for everyone.  It is not perfect, but it is very, very good in several distinct areas.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Social commentary: One way to put &lt;i&gt;District 9&lt;/i&gt; is "Apartheid with Aliens."  It doesn't stop here, though - what happens in the movie are a series of situations that happen in many parts of the world.  As a Global Studies major, I recognized a lot of the interactions between slum dwellers and the government.  Or them and the people exploiting them.  Very much a universal message, though most people do their best to ignore slums and/or xenophobia.  The whole first third of the movie is paradise for this.  Some of the things that happens are truly horrific.  I didn't see anything that humans haven't done to other humans.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Carnage/hilarity/crazy-cool:  It's a very, very sobering movie, but sometimes... people explode.  Or there is the pig cannon (that &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; become a meme).  And there are so many Really Cool Things...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Characterization/character change:  Wikus is, perhaps, one of the most interesting characters I have watched.  Very interesting choice for a main character.  Over the course of the story, there is much character change/rejection-of-change, and even if most of the character change (or lack of change) is Wikus based... it's still great.  Not all the characters change, but some a very intense.  A particular man who stays seated, for instance.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Paradigm-changing:  Most aliens visiting earth have shiney technology, advanced intellect, and tend to generally have halos.  District 9 aliens... not so much.  You'll have to see it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Suspenseful:  In hindsight, the movie makes a lot of sense.  But during the movie, there's a lot of mystery, and I really had no idea where it was going.  Stuff goes down, and it puts people on the edge of their seats, straining to watch what happens next.   So please avoid plot summaries, please avoid TvTropes - watch the movie first.  Like as soon as you can.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So watch District 9.  It's a good movie for people who are not children.  If you live in the new BHC, talk to me about it - I plan on watching it again in theaters.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7161322563694424329-4213065083987719706?l=whatsupnil.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/feeds/4213065083987719706/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2009/09/needs-more-pig-cannon.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/4213065083987719706'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/4213065083987719706'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2009/09/needs-more-pig-cannon.html' title='NEEDS MORE PIG CANNON!'/><author><name>Nil Athelion</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16996018952758178741</uri><email>featherless@gmail.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7161322563694424329.post-4607908077812359294</id><published>2009-08-07T11:03:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2009-08-07T11:49:01.375-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='So you know'/><title type='text'>Self confidence and London.</title><content type='html'>I mentioned on the sad blog recently (amid the crushing of my self-esteem) that my self-confidence and self-esteem were at their highest by the end of the London trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to elaborate that as a tie-in to a much longer post complaining about how my mother insults me nearly continuously, but I figured that while the majority of the post was negative, that this bit was positive, and shouldn't be on the sad blog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why was my self-confidence and self-esteem so high after London?  Readers of my sad-blog know that half-way through the trip I was whining about how I felt distanced from both my fellow ASU students and from the general Londoner population (with the merry exceptions of Joefish and Slightfoxing, who were a pleasure to meet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, first off, I proved that I could be successful.  I survived and (with the exception of what probably was swine flu) stayed healthy.  I got kind of down because of not being accepted at my original job placement, and then later being dismissed from my second job placement, but in the third one... things worked out.  And that was the last one, too, so that left the strongest impression.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How did things work out?  Well, the tasks were readily defined (as opposed to the school, where I had basically no instruction on what to do), and I could do them, so I did them.  Turns out that I am a pretty hard worker - all I was doing was mostly mindless busywork, but... hmm...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I ever mention why I like fighting games (the Tekken, SSBM, Virtua Fighter sort)?  It's not because I am particularly bloodthirsty, or have anywhere near the motor-memory or fine-motor control to be effective at them.  Instead, it is a pursuit of perfection.  Every time I play, I try to optimise my techniques, fiddle with the balance of what I do, and pursue a state of empty mind (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushin"&gt;mushin&lt;/a&gt;, if you will).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doing rote tasks at work is much the same, particularly if they are repetitive.  Each time I find a website to write down the contact info from, I try to improve on it, given the inefficiencies from last time.  Finding out the most likely places to get the appropriate information, figuring out which sites are promising enough to search for other sites via their links... balancing detail and time spent hunting through the website with the benefits of simply going to the next website.  With each iteration, I try to improve the rote algorithms of how to react to a website, doing it fast, doing it better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I hunt for other ways of doing things.  Better ways.  We have a database of email addresses to email out to people, and we would mail 60 at a time - as we selected them off of the worksheet, we looked them over for duplicates, which slowed the selecting.  So I went online, as found a series of excel formulas that I could use to eliminate duplicates (shrinking the registry by over a thousand addresses), searching for common email address misspellings (yahooo.com is a common one, as is anything with a double letter, it seems), searching for two addresses put in the same entry, searching for non-email address characters, eliminating all spaces in front or behind words, standardizing everything to lowercase, and even searching for addresses which did not have an @ sign, which required some out-of-the-box usage of excel's tools.  All of this was via search functions and excel formulas, meaning that I could apply them quickly on the several-thousand-entry data base.&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, this task was not without the same sort of optimization as everything else.  For emailing outwards, I found it was more efficient to open a dozen messages, then copy and paste the same subject line to each one, and correct the message for each one, etc, rather than doing all the changes to each message one message at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sort of stuff I could take pride in, and my bosses were apparently pleased with it all.  Turns out that mindless drudgery is only mindless drudgery if you don't constantly hunt improvements.  If I do wind up flipping burgers, I'm pretty sure I could seek to optimise a balance of speed and quality, and spend my mental energies improving my technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only that, but at work people did appreciate me, did compliment me on doing well, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onwards to reasons other than work, London was a pretty cool place to be, and I greatly enjoyed the museums and performances, and the sights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, while I was in London, I had enough time outside of work to design my own creative stuff.  I made at least two game-design blog-posts while I was there (viewable on earlier happy-blogs, specifically the one on designing a new fighting game, and designing a new space piloting game, both of which showcase my desire for horribly complex game design).  I started designing a DnD campaign, though that eventually had to pause due to my lack of ability to test the game mechanics I was designing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also in London, I got to see Joefish and Slightfoxing, as awesome as previously mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a more personal front, I managed to sort out things romanically, and the result was much better than I feared it would be.  Down-right good, given the circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then, after my internship ended, I went to France, and stated with Bubble B and her family.  Turns out everyone likes me.  Her family thinks that I am well-mannered, well-raised, kind, trustworthy, and perhaps other descriptions that I cannot think of off the top of my head.  And going around Paris with Bubble B was a delightful pleasure, naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then, as I was coming home, I had a visit to Toshiko to look forward to, as well as Krystalangel coming to visit for a week.  Plus DnD on Sundays with Alec, and being in the same timezone as most of my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I got off the plane pretty happy, pretty hopeful, and pretty confident in my abilities.  In fact, while I normally sink into being miserable within the first few hours of interacting with my mother, this time I lasted all the way from getting back Tuesday night until breaking down and crying on the following Friday. (This is still the happy blog.  That was a statement showing just how good I was feeling when I got back.  The story of that all goes in the sad blog.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, that's all I have to say for now.  Time to go help mother with whatever she wants me to help her with.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7161322563694424329-4607908077812359294?l=whatsupnil.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/feeds/4607908077812359294/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2009/08/self-confidence-and-london.html#comment-form' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/4607908077812359294'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/4607908077812359294'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2009/08/self-confidence-and-london.html' title='Self confidence and London.'/><author><name>Nil Athelion</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16996018952758178741</uri><email>featherless@gmail.com</email></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7161322563694424329.post-7920096741638791507</id><published>2009-08-04T13:18:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2009-08-04T13:32:33.030-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Movies on a Plane</title><content type='html'>I watched three movies on the way over the Atlantic (Traveling from London to Calgary, as it were).&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Watchmen&lt;/i&gt; was pretty good.  My version was censored, so I didn't get to see the vaunted Big Blue Penis.  Other than that, I thought it was well done, though I wish that the hero-types didn't occasionally kick people completely accross rooms with... strength they are not supposed to have.  Ozymandias, I can see.  He's supposed to be the absolute peak of physical conditioning, to the point of being unnatural - the other ones?  Not so much.  Also, the second Nite Hawk was too slim.  C'Mon, he's supposed to be a bit overweight.  I liked him like that.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Push&lt;/i&gt; was... meh.  I have to say that it was a pretty decent movie.  It has a complicated plot, the characters are okay, and the special effects are pretty cool.  But the thing that really drives me up the wall is &lt;i&gt;how much potencial&lt;/i&gt; the setting has.  I wouldn't be surprised if there are fan-fics that are better than the movie.  Hell, I'd write a fan-fic set in the same setting.  Not because the movie was actually good--it's just decent--but because the setting is open to so many possiblities.  It's like someone wrote a mediocre plot, with mediocre characters, and then handed the setting creation to someone like me.  Someone who was given the needs of the plot, and went crazy with creating a flavorful and world-comprehensive setting.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Coraline was really good.  I liked it a lot.  Started out a bit slow, but after the first few minutes (I'd mark it as about when she meets the circus man, and then the two old ladies, a bit later) it starts going all kinds of cool.  Reminds me of Psychonauts a lot.  That's a good thing.  You should see the movie.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7161322563694424329-7920096741638791507?l=whatsupnil.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/feeds/7920096741638791507/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2009/08/movies-on-plane.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/7920096741638791507'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/7920096741638791507'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2009/08/movies-on-plane.html' title='Movies on a Plane'/><author><name>Nil Athelion</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16996018952758178741</uri><email>featherless@gmail.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7161322563694424329.post-9212519284474762176</id><published>2009-07-11T16:37:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2009-07-11T17:06:18.543-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Going around.</title><content type='html'>I went to Portobello Road today, on the recommendation of my co-worker Nadzirah.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It was really interesting, with all kinds of cool stuff.  I got presents for a few people, including my dad.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It started raining soon after I got there, but fortunately I had the foresight to bring my umbrella, so I was mostly fine.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;After finishing the road (it was closing up by 6pm), I went over to a restuarant Nadzirah had told me to get duck rice at.  Good stuff.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I walked home, and it stopped raining.  Immediately after, I broke my umbrella - the stick part detached from the umbrella part, which gave me a metal stick to walk around with... and the other part of it.  Fortunately, it didn't rain until I got home.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I lied to Hanna about things, after I got home.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I recommend Portobello Road to anyone in London.

Kinda like virtua fighter, or (with less fantasy) like Tekken.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;General tenets.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Basic stuff: Videogame platform based, one on one matches. Characters kept on memory cards.  No pre-made characters, though an easy-build system based on a few sliding bars can generate characters with decent move-lists.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Character appearance customizable, naturally.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Character tech-lists customizable - there is a quota of points that you spend on techniques, with all-around better moves costing more.  About half to a quarter of the techniques can be bought at one time, assuming lower-cost moves.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Buttons are: Punch, Kick, Grab, Block.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Directional imputs: All directions (hold), all direction (press then release), neutral.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now on to the funner parts - the guts of the game, the way the mechanics work:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Attack speed types:&lt;br /&gt;Quick:Interrupts when nothing is hit-boxing, killed by hitbox (Beats delayed, good against cancelled attacks and feints)&lt;br /&gt;Strong:Constant hit-box (Beats quick) (balances forward?)&lt;br /&gt;Delayed: Evasion then attack, or just a slower, stronger attack (Beats Strong via priority while hitting before hit-box arrives)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Balance:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px; "&gt;(Balance is one of the more special bits of this game)&lt;br /&gt;Balance forward&lt;br /&gt;Balance backward&lt;br /&gt;Balance right&lt;br /&gt;Balance left&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Defenses against attacks:&lt;br /&gt;Block: Take percentage of damage, proprotional stun and sometimes break, no other cooldown.  Basic blocking only blocks attacks from the front of where the character is standing - vulnerable to circular attacks.  Balance can effect damage vs. stun/break ratio.&lt;br /&gt;Parry: Needs timing, takes time to start, static cooldown.&lt;br /&gt;Defensive grab: Needs timing, must match forward or backward balance, auto-hit into grapple or throw.&lt;br /&gt;Interrupt via quick: See earlier triangle.&lt;br /&gt;Dodge: Needs early application, no cooldown, only avoids some types of attacks (duck, sidestep, jump, backstep), heavy balance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Defenses against grabs:&lt;br /&gt;Counterthrow: Throw balancing in the same direction they are balanced to subvert their throw. (note that many throws have balance-backward at some part of their movement, but some balance forward while reaching to grab.)&lt;br /&gt;Hit stun: Throws start attacking, grab, and then throw.  The attack motion is the same as the defensive throw, so an off-balancing attack might get eaten by it, but otherwise hits normally.  Grab solidifies whether it is a defensive throw, or an offensive throw, reduces hit-stun and knock-back - some attacks may not produce enough hit-stun or knockback to knock them out of the throw, or detach them.  Damage is normal.  Throw is too late, though if you have already imputted your own counter-throw, that will still implement.&lt;br /&gt;Resist: use the imput-balance to pull away from the thrower's attack balance.  Mostly pulling away from the opponent, but some throws just go with that.  Does not work if you imputted the wrong throw command.  Note this is the benefit of throws to the side, or throws that get behind the opponent.  Visually, the throw slows and then breaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes on offensive throws:&lt;br /&gt;Some throws can be reversed into other throws if resisted.&lt;br /&gt;Throws have much shorter "grab" time if the person is already off-balance in the direction they are being thrown.&lt;br /&gt;Throws have longer "grab" and "throw" times if the person is balanced away, worse if the player resists it.&lt;br /&gt;(The grab is really just an off-balancing movement that preps for the throw.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get-up defense:&lt;br /&gt;Grab to pull down - into grapple game&lt;br /&gt;Grab to throw - into throw&lt;br /&gt;Attack from ground&lt;br /&gt;Dodge while rising&lt;br /&gt;Defense while rising&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Offense against get-up:&lt;br /&gt;Grab and mount into grapple game&lt;br /&gt;Hit opponent&lt;br /&gt;Respond to get-up choice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grapple:&lt;br /&gt;Positions:&lt;br /&gt;Guard: Person on top has better striking, bottom has worse, bottom has a 2/3 advantage in throw game&lt;br /&gt;Mount: Person on top has better striking, bottom has worse, equal in throws.&lt;br /&gt;Face-down mount: Person on top has better striking, bottom has none, top has 2/3 advantage in anti-throw game.&lt;br /&gt;Options:&lt;br /&gt;Strike: hit the opponent, varying keys and varying possible throws in response&lt;br /&gt;Throw - Reposition: Shifts to a different position&lt;br /&gt;Throw - Release: Throws the opponent into prone into a specific orientation near the throwing grappler&lt;br /&gt;Strangle-hold/submission-hold: Constant damage.  Wiggle/mash to escape, or throw (Each strangle has a throw-release key, but strangles can be shifted into other strangles mid-strangle.) Can strike during strangle, does not release, but works as a wiggle.&lt;br /&gt;Restrain: if successful, negates one button-escape until wiggle-free.  Some throws that go into grapples start with a restrain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Near-Simultaneous grab:&lt;br /&gt;If balance of throws oppose: First wins&lt;br /&gt;If balance of throws same: Second wins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Player Balance Mechanic:&lt;br /&gt;Balance in one of four directions - forward, backward, right, left.&lt;br /&gt;All created by movement, forward and backward can be created by attacks (can shift during attack&lt;br /&gt;Grabs: Determines which defensive grabs work, and balance on opposed grabs determines winner.&lt;br /&gt;Attacks on hit: More damage if balanced into attack, less stun/chance to interrupt; Less damage if balanced alway attack, more stun/chance to interrupt.&lt;br /&gt;Auto-off: Some attacks (particularly kicks) inducing general off-balance penalties when attacked from any direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attack direction:&lt;br /&gt;Some attacks, particularly circular and retreating attacks, have an attack direction distinct from balance.&lt;br /&gt;Circular: attacks from right or left, beats out side-steppers for either more damage or more stun.&lt;br /&gt;Retreating: Often hits forward (weakly) while balance is backwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hit stuns/status effects:&lt;br /&gt;Attack stun: Recoiling from hit, can't initiate new attacks.  Can use control stick to choose forward/backwards/left/right balance.&lt;br /&gt;Induced Off-balance stun: opponent stumbles from attack/throw, balanced in that direction.  Leads to better stun/damage, off-balance lasts a bit longer than actual stun.  Some quick attacks and defensive-throws only provide off-balance, and minimal damage.&lt;br /&gt;Off-balance collapse: If knocked over while balanced away due to the off-balance, stumble in that direction before falling.&lt;br /&gt;Sensory stun: Variable amount of frame-delay on technique initiation - slowed between 1-X frames: Attacks will still happen, but timing is imprecise.(mostly face attacks)&lt;br /&gt;Winded: Reduction in potency of attacks - priority, damage, stun-produced.  May last a bit, reduces faster the less the character does. (Mostly gut attacks)&lt;br /&gt;Gut-blow stun: Produces general off-balance, and auto-ducking.&lt;br /&gt;Crumple stun: Produces general off-balance, auto-ducking, then falling to prone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Misc. Status mods:&lt;br /&gt;Pumped: Increase attack potency for a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Adrenline surge: Ignore damage for a bit, then take all the damage you would have taken.  Post-battle collapse is win, not tie.&lt;br /&gt;Static Crouch: Acts as if automatically balanced opposing attacks: Less stun/push, more damage.  Low mobility options.  Also avoids high. (Note: This is while crouched - intial duck delay until fully crouched is neutral balance.)&lt;br /&gt;Jump: Acts as if automatically balanced away from attacks: Less damage, more stun/push.  Also avoids low. (Blocking in the air... almost garrentteed guard-break.  At least there's less damage.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Special games:&lt;br /&gt;First blood (Lose imput control when damaged, if both players hit, whichever does more damage, if just one, that one loses.)&lt;br /&gt;To knock-down (No damage, first player knocked to the ground loses.)&lt;br /&gt;To Submission (Damage reduces wiggle efficiency but regenerates, first player to hold a submission hold for a specified amount of time wins.)&lt;br /&gt;To Ring-out (Lose when forced off ring.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Misc Character traits:&lt;br /&gt;Regeneration: While no imput is taken, slow regeneration.&lt;br /&gt;Default static crouch: Instead of holding down to stay crouched, hold up to uncrouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Special victories:&lt;br /&gt;Taunt-victory: Three taunts in a row creates victory (forces aggression).&lt;br /&gt;Ring-out: Drive opponent off of ring for victory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feints: Most attacks can be stopped before a certain point, some can be delayed (whiffs throws and parries, weak to quick and dodge), some can be converted into other attacks. (Strong against some dodge and quick, weak into strong and throws and parry)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7161322563694424329-114492395368774874?l=whatsupnil.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/feeds/114492395368774874/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2009/07/pondering-mechanics-for-fighting-game.html#comment-form' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/114492395368774874'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/114492395368774874'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2009/07/pondering-mechanics-for-fighting-game.html' title='Pondering Mechanics for Fighting Game.'/><author><name>Nil Athelion</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16996018952758178741</uri><email>featherless@gmail.com</email></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7161322563694424329.post-79704647603394842</id><published>2009-07-04T07:37:00.003-07:00</published><updated>2009-07-04T07:39:13.472-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Helping out.</title><content type='html'>I got to help out Carolyn and Megan with their luggage (also cleaning up their flat, but that's seperate.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Helped Carolyn carry her massive suitcase down, saw her and her roommate off (both such cool people...).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I helped Megan with her luggage, all the way until she got on the train in the Paddington train station.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Helping people causes me to feel good.  ^.^&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7161322563694424329-79704647603394842?l=whatsupnil.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/feeds/79704647603394842/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2009/07/helping-out.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/79704647603394842'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/79704647603394842'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2009/07/helping-out.html' title='Helping out.'/><author><name>Nil Athelion</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16996018952758178741</uri><email>featherless@gmail.com</email></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7161322563694424329.post-6903234974771200994</id><published>2009-07-03T17:20:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2009-07-03T17:21:13.411-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Paper done, yays.</title><content type='html'>Paper is done!

I told her that I would go there that night after work finished and eat dinner there, but when the time came, I was tired, and just trudged back home.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This afternoon, however, I decided to go over to Chinatown, and see how it was. Perhaps eat dinner there (I had slept in late, and not eaten).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I went over to Piccadilly Circus, and found the appropriate road to take.  Went east, and found that I was seeing an increasing number of orientals on the streets.  Kept going, and found this restuarnt that was serving asian buffet for 6.5 pounds.  Considering that just fish, chips, and mushed peas cost more than that, I was impressed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Took a road in, and found a promenade, complete with chinese-style gateways.  Went down the road....&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It smelled right.  Chinese restuarants, chinese markets... everything has an odor, and this odor provoked all kinds of familiarity.  I went through a few markets, and then headed back to the buffet place.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Oh, food!  I had not eaten that day yet (it was 5pm or so), so I started eating, and eating... and it was good.  The food itself was okay - the sort of stuff that could be expected from a small buffet catering to western tourists.  But it was asian food, and there was rice!  And vegetables!  Tasty vegetables!  And meat that had all manner of actual flavor!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So happy.  Very good meal, and all for only 7.15 (cost plus service charge).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I then went to the markets, and picked out a number of things.  A 6-pack of my favorite Chrysanthemum Tea Drink, a can of Yeo's Sugar Cane juice, a can of Ramboutans in syrup, some dried plum candies, some asian pears, and more.  Probably not all that healthy, but enough to make me very happy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I came back home, and now I am enjoying my Chrysanthemum Tea Drink.  Yay!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7161322563694424329-7693371640967020907?l=whatsupnil.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/feeds/7693371640967020907/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2009/06/chinatown-in-london.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/7693371640967020907'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/7693371640967020907'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2009/06/chinatown-in-london.html' title='Chinatown in London'/><author><name>Nil Athelion</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16996018952758178741</uri><email>featherless@gmail.com</email></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7161322563694424329.post-2343672527411475989</id><published>2009-06-27T11:16:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2009-06-27T11:39:01.376-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>People.</title><content type='html'>People, people...&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'm getting to know my co-workers at Africa Recruit better.  I went to lunch with my fellow intern, a young lady from Malaysia.  Turns out she's from KL, where I've been most years when my mother visits her family.  Very interesting history on how she wound up here.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I wound up talking to DolphinCheddar again.  She is coolness.  We talked about stuff.  About relationships, too.  Afterwards, reflecting on her, I realized just how much she has contributed to the things I enjoy.  Gunnerkrigg Court, Avatar: The Last Airbender, etc.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Off-topic: Have you ever seen those "Want to find a date in [your city]?" ads?  They always have all these pictures of girls posing half-naked, trying to be sexy.  But that doesn't eally appeal to myself or DolphinCheddar, so we thought: instead of posting a picture, and trying to look sexily lewd, the people get to post a sentence, and see who they can attract off of that.  Probably wouldn't work, but an interesting thought.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I talked to Christy a bit, too.  Told her about my Westnoth victory.  We resolved to play a two-person game together sometime.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I found out that my friend Carolyn is leaving on the 4th of July.  She's the person whose personality appeals to me the most here.  It's sad to know she is going.  She's in Dublin right now, and then we have our internships, and then she goes.  Sad.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I saw a paraplegic in a ballet/moderndance performance, over in Greenwich.  Watching him dance so gracefully in his wheelchair was rather inspirational.  I wonder what drive got him there in life?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Two of my best friends want to date me.  Don't know what to do to avoid hurting someone, or hurting both of them...  At least I'm highly attracted to both of them, so it's not a matter of getting what I want as well.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;One of my flatmates had a bad night last night.  Did my best to help.  I wonder if that means that we will be more friendly with each other now?  I guess everyone leaves in a few weeks, though...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7161322563694424329-2343672527411475989?l=whatsupnil.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/feeds/2343672527411475989/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2009/06/people.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/2343672527411475989'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/2343672527411475989'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2009/06/people.html' title='People.'/><author><name>Nil Athelion</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16996018952758178741</uri><email>featherless@gmail.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7161322563694424329.post-2294668039291993499</id><published>2009-06-27T11:12:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2009-07-27T16:03:08.843-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Gaming'/><title type='text'>Westnoth</title><content type='html'>Minor post.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I finished one of the campaigns on The Battle for Westnoth.

Not hard for me to imagine, given my current circumstances.  Now how much money would it be to hire someone to instead good internet of awesomenes?  Some amount, right?  A thousand dollars, let's say.  Since there are 100 of us or so in this building, that's really only ten dollars per person.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So what about this kind of solution:  You get a secure box, paypal account, whatever, and then you put the total cost of the installation onto the box.  People put in however much they want to contribute, based on how important better internet is for them.  5 dollars?  Ten dollars?  Twenty dollars?  Then when the money reaches the threshold, install internets with the money, and invest any surplus into a trust which feeds maintainance costs.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Obviously there are some logistical problems, but I really kinda like the idea.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But what if we could implement that better?  Say with free money-transfer, digital boxes, etc.  Organized.  For local government, say - you want a road someplace, you go dedicate money to the fund, when it fills up enough, then it would be made.  Only the people who want the road will pay for it, and in the amount that they value it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Traditional taxation is still important for maintainance money, health/social care, etc., but for initiatives, it seems like a nifty system.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I wonder where all the places in which this sort of thing could be applied...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7161322563694424329-6441429049042884772?l=whatsupnil.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/feeds/6441429049042884772/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2009/06/voting-in-cash.html#comment-form' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/6441429049042884772'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/6441429049042884772'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2009/06/voting-in-cash.html' title='Voting in cash?'/><author><name>Nil Athelion</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16996018952758178741</uri><email>featherless@gmail.com</email></author><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7161322563694424329.post-4400200988602266872</id><published>2009-06-17T09:34:00.003-07:00</published><updated>2009-07-27T16:05:35.831-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='So you know'/><title type='text'>Job</title><content type='html'>Job is good in a variety of ways.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;First off, I can do it - this is a definite plus.  Right now I'm really only doing digital stuff, but I think I'll be able to build up my confidence as a worker, and probably manage... okay.  But I am very happy that the instructions and goals are clear.  If I know what I'm trying to do, and I know the resources at my disposal, then it's just a matter of optimizing a complex system, no different from, say, winning at MTG.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Second, it seems to be right up my alley, in terms of what SGS teaches.  My organization promotes a healthy relationship between African governments and their expatriate diasporas.  So all those Tanzanians living abroad send back remittences in their mail... but AfricaRecruit steps in and has the government make a formal process they can do it.  How is this useful?  Well, if it is properly processed, then you have paperwork of past payments, so if you want to apply for a loan, then you can show your income is steady... including the remittance payments you might be recieving.  It also promotes reversing the brain-drain - instead of all the smart people leaving the country to find opprotunities in first world countries, those same people are being attracted back to use their western-trained skills in their country.  Or to invest in their former state's industries.  All kinds of cool stuff, and exactly the dynamic that SGS is striving to describe.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Third, it's doing a good thing.  I am not a fan of giving to charity.  I see these people with signs of how your 5 dollars can save a life in Africa, and I don't really care.  In fact, I resent such organizations.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Why?  Because they are giving people fish, rather than teaching them how to fish.  (Metaphorically.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Don't buy medicines for sick Africans, build a healthcare system that will provide for them and their children and each generation there on.  Don't buy food for someone - invest in Africa argriculture.  Don't see a disaster happen on the news and send money - invest in disaster prevention/mitigation/recovery governmental organizations.  Invest in African companies, invest in African schools, invest in sustainable industries (Avoid mining/drilling, though).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That's what AfricaRecruit is doing - it works with the Diaspora and African governments to help build capacity via foreign direct investment, skill-placement (a very related organization is FindaJobinAfrica.com - they are across the table from where I sit), and mutual assistance.  And building capacity is what will bring Africa into the first world, not aid.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I am proud to work for AfricaRecruit, even if I am doing grunt labor.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7161322563694424329-4400200988602266872?l=whatsupnil.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/feeds/4400200988602266872/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2009/06/job.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/4400200988602266872'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/4400200988602266872'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2009/06/job.html' title='Job'/><author><name>Nil Athelion</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16996018952758178741</uri><email>featherless@gmail.com</email></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7161322563694424329.post-2812171346137046654</id><published>2009-06-16T17:42:00.004-07:00</published><updated>2009-07-27T16:02:14.695-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='MTG'/><title type='text'>Bad Eggs (MTG)</title><content type='html'>&lt;div&gt;So I was relaxing after an apparently successful interview, and thought I would make a deck with that new Thopter Foundry card.  I thought, hey - maybe I could put it in extended, with Roar of Reclaimation!  Then I wondered how to get plenty of artifacts in my graveyard and get the Roar.  But I was going to use Etherium Sculptor/Eggs, I probably would need something to get them to go faster, so I found Rings of Brightheath, and went for a "I draw my library, I now have everything I need to win, I win via infinite Conjurer's Bauble recursion."  But it turns out that Rings could be used the way I was hoping, so I downgraded the draw engine and found it couldn't draw the whole deck anymore.  So I changed the win condition so that I need a combonation of cards, and not an empty library to recur things on.  So I came up with Myr Retrievers and Grinding Station and Etherium Sculptor combo.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It's such a horrible idea--the combo uses 5 pieces--but somehow I have been going off anywhere from turn three to turn 8.  The mean is about 5, and the mode is 4.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I don't know why it works, but it does.  I might buy this deck, actually...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Bad Eggs.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;---------------&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Qty&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Name&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;// Lands&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Blasted Landscape&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;4&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Crystal Vein&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Lonely Sandbar&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;4&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Saprazzan Skerry&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Island&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;// Artifact Creatures&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;4&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Myr Retriever&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;4&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Etherium Sculptor&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;//Artifacts&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Mossfire Egg&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;4&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Skycloud Egg&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;4&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Chromatic Sphere&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;4&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Cloud Key&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Grinding Station&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;4&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Fabricate&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;4&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Chromatic Star&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;4&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Conjurer's Bauble&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;4&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Darkwater Egg&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;4&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Mishra's Bauble&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[New: http://forums.gleemax.com/showthread.php?t=1206519  (The Deck's threat on the Wizards forum.

since I started writing (The Legend of &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2"&gt;Trazin&lt;/span&gt; is set in &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3"&gt;Drahkimar&lt;/span&gt;, albeit on the floating continent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Today's topic is the boundaries of the Dominion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4"&gt;Vakemia&lt;/span&gt; is probably the main setting at the heart of &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5"&gt;Drahkimar&lt;/span&gt; - all the surrounding lands, and the lands surrounding those, were originally answering the question of "what's over that direction?"&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Dominion 'borders' &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6"&gt;Vakemia&lt;/span&gt; on it's west.  It is about twice as large as &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_7"&gt;Vakemia&lt;/span&gt; in size, shaped somewhat like a cross between a rectangle and an amoeba.  On the west half, the boundaries are pretty clear:  On the north there are the poisoned lands and the rot-iron mountains.  Unconquered due to it being blighted and mostly worthless.  On the south and southwest there is the &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_8"&gt;Alterrian&lt;/span&gt; mountain range (though it continues to diminish the further it goes west, eventually just being foothills and nothing special), as well as the &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_9"&gt;Jurungald&lt;/span&gt;.  The mountains are something of an annoyance, as see in the case of the kingdom of &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_10"&gt;Alterria&lt;/span&gt;, but most of the border is due to the presence of the &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_11"&gt;Jurungi&lt;/span&gt;.  As powerful as the Dominion is, they can barely fight a war on three fronts, let alone on four.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Directly west of west (the Dominion has been conquering west for quite some time), at the current boundaries, is &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_12"&gt;Vakemia&lt;/span&gt;.  If you think of the &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_13"&gt;Alterrian&lt;/span&gt; mountain range and the poisoned lands as north and south boundaries that both &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_14"&gt;Vakemia&lt;/span&gt; and the Dominion share, then &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_15"&gt;Vakemia&lt;/span&gt; is at the end of a long corridor, with the Dominion pressing onwards and inwards.  &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_16"&gt;Vakemia&lt;/span&gt; proper is only on the west side of Mt. &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_17"&gt;Keres&lt;/span&gt;, and the sweep of mountains north from there is what the Twelve Lords once considered the bounds of their territory (Mt. &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_18"&gt;Keres&lt;/span&gt; is the highest peak of the &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_19"&gt;Alterrian&lt;/span&gt; mountain range, massively triggered by the Apocalypse long, long ago). &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Dominion has been pressing onwards continually, lead by the Children, and so a few decades ago they started to push around the north end of the &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_20"&gt;Keres&lt;/span&gt; mountain range and entered into open war with the western kingdoms of present day &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_21"&gt;Vakemia&lt;/span&gt;.  While the armies of the Dominion are one of the best martial fighting forces in &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_22"&gt;Drahkimar&lt;/span&gt;, organized and well-trained, &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_23"&gt;Vakemia&lt;/span&gt; presented a foe that they had never fought before.  All of the Dominion's other lands and neighbors are mundane, so they are not used to fighting a foe armed with both steel and magic, nor are they used to surviving in a magical land.  Moral is low, and their tactics are relatively ineffective.  This has not kept them from overwhelming several kingdoms, and causing one to retreat out of existence.  Shortly after the present day, a particular charismatic leader leads a revolt in the West Army(similar to legendary China, their are four armies after the four compass directions).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;On the eastern side of the Dominion, less is known.  If one were to walk along the north boundary of the Dominion, the rot-iron mountains would be left behind, and later the poisoned lands would end as well.  Continuing onwards, you would eventually come across a rather large inland sea.  Between the poisoned lands and the water, there is near-constant fighting between the northern barbarians and the North Army.  Settlers from the Dominion have been colonizing further and further upwards, following the side of the sea north and then west and the North Army's role is largely to protect them from the more inland-based barbarians.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The sea is not all that wide, and the Dominion has started colonizing on the other side of the sea, crushing their &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_24"&gt;demi&lt;/span&gt;-human cousins there.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Following the ocean south, the Dominion expands quite a distance south.  This is the southern thrust of the Dominion, and is, for once, at peace.  The southern thrust is &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_25"&gt;borderned&lt;/span&gt; on the east by the inland sea.  The Dominion continues south until it reaches the same river that goes west to support the Northern (Desert) Kingdom.  On the other side of the river is the Southern Empire, and the two are at peace and enjoy a healthy amount of trade.  Following the river west from the inland sea brings you to increasing aridity and eventually the Desert.  Some hardy settlers have colonized westward, but there is decreasing appeal to the land the further west you go.  Following this very, very rough boundary north, it takes you to a smaller lake, where some of the rivers in the Dominion pool before going around south of the &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_26"&gt;Alterria&lt;/span&gt; range and going west rather than east.  Going around the west of the lake would bring you into the &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_27"&gt;Jurungald&lt;/span&gt;, so going around east keeps you in the Dominion, and links up to the southern boundary of the western Dominion.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And there you have it - the boundaries of the Dominion.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Of the bordering lands, the barbarians up north and the &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_28"&gt;proto&lt;/span&gt;-humans to the east (other side of the big sea) were never fleshed out.  Well, I mean I know what the &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_29"&gt;proto&lt;/span&gt;-humans are, since they figure in the history of the area, but I don't know how they are in this present day - the people in the area that I deal with are all what I refer to as humans.  (Except the &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_30"&gt;Archipelago, which are Vi'nari by blood.)  (Actually except the Krt'kta, the elves, the elves, and the Jurungi, plus all of the Vakemia demi-races... but all the proto-humans have interbreed with other things.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7161322563694424329-1206412372438246972?l=whatsupnil.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/feeds/1206412372438246972/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2009/04/drahkimar-1.html#comment-form' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/1206412372438246972'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/1206412372438246972'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2009/04/drahkimar-1.html' title='Drahkimar 1'/><author><name>Nil Athelion</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16996018952758178741</uri><email>featherless@gmail.com</email></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7161322563694424329.post-9113928405637880317</id><published>2009-04-20T02:41:00.007-07:00</published><updated>2010-06-01T14:42:30.325-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Game Design'/><title type='text'>DnD quest thread thing.</title><content type='html'>A few levels back, shortly after we advanced to 8th level and got all our magic things, we assaulted a crypt with a vampire lord and some elemental guardians.  Final battle against the vampire had us attacking him with a great number of minions on his side.  It also was the infamous encounter where Selnar (my character) got dominated and critted Bryan to death.  Anyway, I happened across the Monster Manual's Vampire Lord entry, and it got me thinking...&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Here's how I would have had a vampire lord in DnD if I were the DM.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Adventure is for five 6th level PCs, assuming they are fairly strong. Level 7 is also a possiblity.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;PCs, being wandering heros and the like, recieve a message from a small town, requesting help.  Young men are found dead in the morning with no obvious injuries, and rise against as terrible creatures the next sunset.  The towns wants help removing the curse that has been afflicting their town, and has turned to the PCs.  He offers to pay money as well.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A DC 20 religion check at this point can determine that the people rising are vampire spawn, folks killed by a vampire lord's bite.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Upon arriving, they are met by the mayor, and who tells them that the previous night he lost his son.  If the PCs arrive the same day they were contacted, he sent the message when he found his dead son.  If not, then it is unrelated.  He asks the PCs to watch the body of his son at sunset.  Until then, the PCs can go around the town and gather information (diplomacy checks DC 10 then 15, one to engage the townsfolk interviewed, one to illicit interesting information - checks cover all info-gathering, and each PC has two tries before sunset).  Depending on how many of the five characters have success with the interviews:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1 success: Each victim was killed during the night, and rose as a nasty creature when the sun set the next day.  Several families were killed by their loved one rising and attacking them while they were waiting to be buried.  (PCs get another vampire-spawn religion check if they want, DC 15)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2 successes: The people killed have all were young, healthy, and male.  The mortician was killed by one of the spawn.  The attacks started two weeks ago.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3 successes:  The first victims were found killed on the street.  When people stopped going out at night, the attacks abated for several days, then resumed with young men killed in their beds with no sign of entry.  Also, three weeks ago, raiders attacked the town and killed a number of people and looted a bit before the town guard and militia grabbed their weapons and belately fought back.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;4 successes: Many of the victims attacked were members of the town guard, and some people think it is related.  All of the people killed in bed were members of the town guard.  The town temple was attacked during the raid, killing the priest and his two assistants.  No holy healing was preformed after the raid, and many of the injured died of infected wounds days after the attack.  Raiders were orcs.  Many of the recent victims were chained and sealed underground in coffins.  Of those that were not, four killed their entire families and vanished, while the two others were put down by the dwindling guard, killing two of them in the process.  (DC 20 Religion says that the four survivors would have either attacked more people or sought out their maker)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;5 successes:  The first three men killed in bed were sleazy characters, known for drinking, womanizing,  and getting away with it by abusing their power and authority. The other two, including the Mayor's son, were captains of the guard, but not known for abusing their power.  The four victims who slew their entire families and escaped were never seen or heard of since, though there were no attacks the nights afterwards.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Other specific questions that could be asked:  The town graveyard has had minor ghost problems in the past, but nothing the priest, the local hedge-wizard, and the mortician could not handle.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If the PCs ask about the hedge-wizard, they find out that he is extremely old, and weak.  His granddaughter was one of those who died after the raid, and he shut himself up in his house, refusing to speak to anyone, after he was unable to save her.  He is of no help, and the townsfolk worry about stirring ghosts.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Raiders were orcs from the nearby mountain range.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Asking about surrounding caves or tombs comes up mostly negative.  One small cave held kobolds a decade back, but was too small for medium sized creatures.  The towns folk poured oil into it, and set it aflame.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A decade ago, elves settled in the forest.  This stopped logging, and the town's economy never truly recovered.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;All of these are brought up in conversation, no roll needed - obviously some need prior knowledge to ask the right questions (do not volunteer information).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Insight check (DC15) about the proportions of Town Guards to the total population of young men reveals that only a quarter of the young males are part of the town guard, while over 75% of the victims killed were of the town guard.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Each character can only interview one day's worth of people before sunset, but if any particular characters are willing not to monitor the mayor's son during the night, they can do a second check to gather more information.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Staying with the corpse until sunset has it rise as a level 5 vampire spawn bloodhunter, attacking the PCs in a frenzy - two attacks in the surprise round it awakens, and two each round thereafter.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The mayor is shocked by the change in his son, and goes a bit crazy.  If the PCs take more than one round to kill it, or somehow mutilate him with powerful attacks (DM judgement), he is traumatized and will not talk to the PCs.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Shortly after the vampire spawn attacks, there is female screaming that can be heard from the temple, behind which is the graveyard.  If the PCs investigate, there are normal screams coming from inside of the temple, and an unearthly scream from behind.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If they PCs try to go in: The temple is locked, but the doors can be busted down with a DC 25 strength check.  If the PCs try the windows, they are easy to break, but the PCs take 1 damage from sharp glass and have to climb/wiggle in one at a time.  Breaking down the door or window elicits more screams, and an impromptu attack by one of the occupants (+7 (including CA from surprise) charging attack with a 1d6 chair by a monk).  Once they realise who came in, the monk and two nuns direct the PCs to the back of the temple.  Their is a town guard bracing against the back door, with thuds on the other side from something trying to bash in.  As they approach, the door is instead pulled/ripped outwards, and the guard stumbles out into the open, and is attacked and killed by three vampire spawn minions.  The PCs can see the three minions, but the female screams are coming from something else out there.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Leaving the temple leads to the same encounter that circling it does: one wailing ghost, one trap haunt, and the full 6 formerly-chained vampire spawn.  The only difference is that the door (and the guard) stay intact if the PC circle way around (and no glass or monk damage).  As the PCs get a good view, they can see one of the vampire spawn pull the door off of a coffin in a shallow pit, and a chained vampire spawn emerges.  The other vampire helps it break the chains.  (The cinematic spawn is one of the six.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Vampire spawn killed turn to ash.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A DC 20 perception check during the battle looking around can reveal a shadowy figure on the roof of a near-by building.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Once the two ghosts are killed, or 4 of the spawn, the remaining vampire spawn flee down an alley, but are attacked by the vampire lord (see later) and probably easily destroyed.  If the PCs follow, they see the combat if they are in time, if not, they see a shadowy woman crouching over some ashes and letting them fall from between it's fingers.  She is wearing a very ordinary blue dress, with a black cloak over it.  She makes a stealth check to hide her nature from the PCs, pulling the hood low and hurrying away.  Opposed insight checks on players turns can identify her, as does passive insight if she rolls low enough.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;She runs away at full speed.  If the PCs pursue, she tries to elude them.  If they seem to be catching up or trying to attack her or any of them tell each other that she is a vampire, she takes gaseous form, going through a building to elude her pursuers.  If they break into the building, she is already gone.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Information PCs get off the bat is that she is female and relatively young, and quite shapely.  If they don't know she is a vampire, they consider her quite fast.  If they know she's a vampire this should not be relevant.  During the encounter, she should take pains to hide her identity, both her nature and her face.  Active Insight or perception checks as to who she is always reveal no recognition as if a failure ("You don't recognize her face.") but are relevant for later checks if they score a 15 or higher, as they can describe her better to townsfolk - only the PCs doing the check will get this bonus later on.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The PCs can search onwards once she takes gaseous form or loses them, but automatically fail.  The town guard tries to calm people down concerning the screaming and combat heard - people are peering out of their windows, though keeping them closed.  The PCs may rest the rest of the night in the major's home, but it is their choice.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The next day, the PCs can go around asking for more evidence.  This includes any information they failed to get the prior day, plus asking about the dark lady/vampire they saw.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DC 20 insight checks, 2 complexity, can find information from people who were looking out their windows and saw the chase from different angles.  The people living on the alley and chase route know, but if the PCs do not specifically ask them, any person they are interrogating has a 1/6th chance to be an onlooker.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If the PCs saw the face, they can describe it to any townsfolk, and get an answer DC 20 insight.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Either way, the townsfolk recognise the figure as being the deceased granddaughter of the town hedge-wizard.  Presumably this leads to a confrontation with the old man.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;House is two story, relatively small and normal looking.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Assuming they just knock on the door, he tells them to go away.  Diplomacy checks are encouraged, but the door opens when they mention his granddaughter in the diplomacy checks.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If they bust in the door, they find him making soup.  He screams and cowers, telling them to not hurt him.  He thinks they are raiders, not being up-to-date with their arrival and inquiries around town, and offers them anything they want.  No resistance.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Interogating him, skill challenge complexity 5:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Intimidation checks auto-fail, with him turning into a gibbering wreck.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Diplomacy checks are the main work-horse.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Perception checks looking at his wares reveal a mix of implements and other tools, uniformly neutral and good aligned with the exception of a small altar to Orcus on a table in the back room.  If this is brought up, it auto-counts as a success.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Perception checks exploring his house reveal a trap-door under a carpet, with a stair-way leading to a basement.  If the PCs go down it, the man screams frantically for them not to go down there, giving a multitude of incoherent excuses, from delicate wares to a toxic accident to their being nothing of interest down there.  If the PCs continue, they find a steel door.  DC 30 to break down, plus the considerable opposed strength checks on the other side by the vampire lady.  Whoever is trying to break down the door notices a undead aura eminating from the other side of the door.  If they persist, after 5 tries the vampire lady tells them to stop, and tells them that her grandfather knows where the key is, and pleads for them to treat the old man well.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Succeeding the skill challenge has the old man admitting the following story:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When his daughter and his son-in-law died, he raised their daughter as a father.  She grew to be a beautiful young woman, and used to flirt with all the young men.  He assumed that she would be married off her pick of the possible suitors, but instead she asked him to become part of the local nunnery.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When the raiders attacked, she tried to defend the priest, but was struck down.  With the priest dead, and the other nuns busy taking care of the injured town-folk, she was expected to care for herself until they were free.  However, her wound from the rusty axe became infected, and her grandfather brought her home to try his own implements.  She continued to waste away, and he prayed to the gods for her to be healed.  Neither she nor the other victims (under the care of the remaining three nuns) got better, and one by one they wasted away.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;He sent a letter to the temple of the Raven Queen in the nearby city (the one the PCs were in), but the reply told him to let her die, that her time had come.  Outraged, he cursed the Raven Queen's name, and invoked Orcus to give his daughter the chance the Raven Queen had denied.  To his surprise, he was seized by a vision of a magic ritual from Orcus, and the knowledge that the ritual would save his daughter.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;He preformed the ritual, but soon afterwards his daughter died.  Researching the magic he had preformed, he discovered the ritual was to create a vampire lord from the living.  He hurried home and much to his surprise his granddaughter was on her feet, gorging herself on his spell components - the ones that included blood.  She saw him and asked him what had he done to her.  He replied honestly, and she fled into the basement and slammed the door, horrified at what he had made her into.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;He talked with her outside the basement door, and calmed her down.  He was willing to give her a nightly supply of his own blood, and she could live in his basement, safe from the prying eyes of others.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;He grew weak from giving his blood, and his granddaughter soon began to refuse it, on the basis of it slowly killing him.  (If the PCs check, this was around the time the killings began.)  His daughter has stayed in the basement ever since.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If the PCs ask him whether he knows about the killings, he will admit he has heard something of them, but note that the metal door is locked from the outside.  Other than that, he evades the topic of his grand-daughter being responsible, and denies any possiblity, citing the door.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If the PCs ask him to unlock the door, he will first make them promise not to hurt his grand-daughter, who is still completely innocent in his eyes.  He then goes down the stairs and opens it with the magic password, "Myralice."&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Upon entering the room, they find the vampire lady sitting placidly on her coffin, non-threateningly.  If they approach her threateningly, she raises her hands and tells them she wants to talk.  Her grandfather also makes a ruckus about the promise.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The room also contains all manner of alchemical instruments, compotents, ritual components, etc.  Not all of it seems to have been used in quite some time.  A DC 20 insight check gives the realization that the grandfather, old as he is, is not the original wizard in the family - much of the equipment is for much more complex spellcraft than the kind the hedge-wizard seems capable of.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;She asked her grandfather to leave, telling him that she needs to talk to the adventurers privately.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;She tells the adventurers that, yes, she has been the one behind the killings. She never wanted to be a vampire, but now that she was, every night she has been filled by an insatable urge to feed.  She would smell and hear the fresh blood flowing through their bodies as they walked in the alleys next to the house.  One night found she could turn herself into a gas, and used it to seep out onto the street, and she attacked the young man in the alley next to her house.  His blood tasted so much more fresh than the old blood provided by her grandfather, and she knew she could not go back to the stale juice of her grandfather.  She hunted randomly at first, but when she met and slew the spawns of her creation, she came to realise that with her strength and abilities, she could attack whoever she wanted.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Doubt flickers in her eyes at this point, and instead of continuing the story, she says different stuff:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;She tells the PCs that she knows they are here to kill her, and she is willing to let them kill her.  To her, this is a false life, and she died two weeks and a half ago - she knows that she is killing people, that that it is wrong, but she cannot help herself.  She asked them to do what she could not bring herself to do, and end her life.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;She rolls forward off the coffin with surprising grace, and lies down on the ground, face down. She asked the PCs to tell her father whatever story will make him happy... she doesn't know anymore. PCs get one coup de grace, but right before they hit her, she shrieks, turns insubstancial, and sinks into the floor via a drain.  DC 15 insight says that leads to the town's river, as seen earlier while information gathering.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If the PCs leave immediately, they can see her in gaseous form, flying swiftly towards the nearby forest.  On the road in that direction they can see a caravan of wagons on the road next to the forest - she heads towards that, but passes out of sight due to being semi-transparent.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The PCs have some options now.  They can ask around town and gather information about the forest, trading caravans, traits of a vampire (from the folks in the temple, and specifically their books, which have the DMG's vampire template on it (sans the stuff requiring the lady to be 11th level)).  Among information gathered about vampires, they will find the Monster Manual blurb about coffins.  Forest traits are that is occupied by elves, and a no-go zone for humans, due to the elves and other forest creatures.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The PCs could immediately start to chase the vampire.  If this brings them to the caravan (2 hours of fast travel), they will find that the caravan is hiding a raiding party of orcs inside the wagons, with a single, very scared, man driving the oxen pulling the wagon.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This leads to the following encounter:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1 Orc Bloodrager&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1 Orc Eye of Gruumsh&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;6 Orc Warriors (minions!)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If the scared man survives the fight (he runs away, but can be killed by misjudged AOE effects, etc. He will tell you that one of the orcs was found dead an hour or two ago, causing an uproar.  The PCs can find the corpse and cut off its head and otherwise mutilate it to avoid its rebirth as a vampire spawn.  The dead orc looks very similar to the Bloodrager - a brother, perhaps.  Each dead orc has an axe (aside from the Eye, but the orc killed by the vampire is missing his axe and his armor.  History/insight check says that orcs are buried in their armor with their weapons, but his are entirely missing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Further enquiry with the man reveals that the warrior wandered off of the trail and over a hill, then never came back.  Insight check if the party researched vampires says it probably was the victim of Dominating Gaze.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Orcish loot is in the wagon as well - the only treasure interesting to the PCs is the gold, unless severed fingers and shrunken skulls are their thing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The road is very close to the forest at this point.  DC 25 nature check can trail the trail of the vampire from over the hill (the man can point it out) into the forest.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Entering the forest is uneventful, but after a few minutes of walking, two unarmed elves come out of nowhere and tell the part to turn back or face violence.  They are very terse in their choice of words (or lack of works).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Diplomacy checks auto-fail - the two elves are firm in their insistance that you leave.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Intimidate automatically provokes combat.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Insight versus bluff reveals that one or two of them (depending on check successes) are dryads.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;After 10 minute of negotiation, or a time seeming like that, two dire wolves and a normal-looking wolf arrive.  At this point the Dryads demand the party leaves, and if they do not, they attack.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If the party tries to intimidate them, they shed their elf disguises and attack.  They fight with hit and run tactics via tree stride (the forest is thick enough when generated that no two trees have more than three squares between them), always retreating towards the same direction, parallel to the edge of the forest.  If the PCs retreat, they chase continue to hound them with hit-and-run attacks.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Depending on how long the diplomacy took, in 1 to 5 rounds the rest of their group arrives.  In total:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2 Dryads&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2 Dire Wolves&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1 Werewolf&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If the combat takes more than 10 rounds, elves arrive en masse and demand that both parties stop fighting.  The remaining forest-folk back off (werewolf continues regeneration), elves care for the fallen (both sides).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(If they left the forest, an elf runner appears shortly after they leave, and invites them inside - they meet the full forest company.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Their leader asked the party what relationship they have with the deadly girl who has intruded into the forest, and has been picking off elves.  Insight check or guesswork concludes that the girl is drinking lots of blood to make up for the lack of a coffin.  Conversation concerning PC aims occurs, with the elves finding out what they can about vampires.  Elf runners are dispatched to behead the dead elves.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Elves ask the PCs to come to the elf camp with them.  On the way, they find a dead elf runner, largely drained of blood.  His tunic is ripped open, and cuts on his chest spell "murderer."&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If the PCs ask the Elves about them seizing the forest and not allowing humans to enter, they evade the topic.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;All the characters of the forest so far gather in the large elf-camp for protection, save for the dire wolves, who patrol around.  The night passes without disturbance.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The next day, the PCs and Elves try to figure out how to hunt the Vampire.  If the PCs do not come up with a plan, the elves suggest that the vampire might be hiding in one of the caves.  They refuse to go in, but lead the humans to the entrance.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The cave goes down quite a bit (full darkness - use sunrods etc), and a DC 15 insight check by anyone who has been in a mine before recognises it as a mine.  Several of the mine shafts (going straight down) give off bad vibes, and sending a light down or exploring it reveals a multitude of human bones at the bottom, with some remains of clothes (belt buckles, buttons, etc.).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;At the very end of the main mining tunnel, there is the dead body of a elf maiden.  Again, the clothes (dress in this case) has been ripped open, and words written on the chest: "Fools."&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Nothing else of interest is in the mine, though sleazy sorts could loot the body for a pair of fine elven footpads (+1 stealth).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Upon immerging from the mine, the dead bodies of elves lay all around the clearing near the mine-shaft, and the vampire is sitting on a tree, only slightly wounded.  She is wearing leather armor now, and has an axe resting on one slender shoulder.  Her chin and neck and clothes are drenched with blood.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"Do you think this was wrong of me to do?  I don't think so."&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If the PCs tell her that it was wrong:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"No it's not.  Elves kill humans, now I kill elves.  I could kill humans too, but that would make me no better than these creatures."&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DC 15 diplomacy on why reveals:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"My father was a logger, back before the elves came.  He used to chop firewood for the house and for market.  One day, the elves moved in, claimed the forest like it was theirs.  Dad told us that he didn't think that a little bit of logging mattered, and if it did, he was sure he could sort it out with the elves.  He went to the forest, and didn't come back that night.  The next day, my mother went to the forest.  She came in peace.  She didn't come back later.  You've seen the burial the elves gave my parents.  Killed and dumped down a mine-shaft.  I should have come here right away, never killed those wicked men in the town."&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If it comes up, she will admit that she can't tell right from wrong anymore, not in her heart, but she remembers what she thought before she died.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If the PCs ask about the wicked men in town, she looks away and states that they deserved it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;After that question, or any failed diplomacy check, or any attempt to attack her, she leaves via gaseous form.  Almost immediately, the two dryads treestride out of the tree she was standing on, and one claws her ineffectively while the other leaps and stabs her with a small dagger.  She immediately reverts to her natural female form, and falls from the tree (20 feet) with the dryad on top of her.  She strikes back in midair with her axe, and the dryad lands under her and her axe, the axe chopping through her completely.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Encounter:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1 Vampire Lady&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ally: 1 Dryad.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Vampire spends the first round trying to pull the axe from the dryad's wooden body - players automatically get initative all before her.  If they hit her before she her turn starts, she instead grabs a spear from a nearby dead elf, and fights with that.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;She starts at -15 health, and once she become bloodied (without a blood drain and second wind), she will attempt to flee by foot.  Foot speed is slowed down by the heavy forest as people have to navigate around trees.  The dryad, having treestride, will do her best to teleport in front of the vampire and force an OA.  Vampire will attack the Dryad until the party catches up and damages her, in which case she will continue to run.  If the dryad dies, it's up to the party to catch up with the Vampire and stop her, with their less than perfect foot speed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If the vampire is killed, she looks peaceful and whispers 'thanks' to the PCs, and crumbles to dust.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For her to get away, she must be out of LOS to make successful stealth check, and then starts moving slowly.  If no member the party can find her in five minutes, she regains gaseous form and is gone.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Failure grants half-XP.  Going back to the original battle-site finds a +2 Shapeshifter's Sorrow dagger on the dead Dryad, and a few other magic items on the elves.  Footpads can be looted from each of the shoes.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Going back to the town with the news of the dead vampire and the dead elves is greatly welcomed.  If the PCs killed the vampire, they get twice the original amount offered - the original payment plus another of the same amount for the elves being dead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If the PCs did not kill the Vampire, they can still bluff the mayor into paying them the full amount.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If they do not bluff, they gain half the amount (whe original amount offered) for driving the vampire away.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If they fail the bluff, they don't get any of the reward for the vampire.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Vindictive vampire lady, if still living (escaped), can return in other adventures later on, as a templated vampire of level appropriate for the PCs at that time.  Probably 2-weapon ranger, given her personality.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It's implied that the men from the town guard abused her at some point - the thread is: her being young and attractive, her sudden choice to become a nun, her uncomfortableness (as a vampire, no less) with talking about the men, and her comment that they deserved to die.  It could be speculated that the two town guard captains, which not participating themselves, turned a blind eye of their fellows' misbehavior.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Personality notes - she lost her soul to Orcus when she became a vampire, and can no longer to the things people do with soul.  Like have morals.  She does miss being a human, however, and tries to act like it, even if she doesn't feel like it.  Tries to be nice to her grandfather, as that's what she would have done if she were alive, same with her choice of victims - she certainly remembers wanting certain people to die.  Her killing her vampire spawn has to do with her not wanting messiness, or hurting the families she used to care for as a nun.  Basically, she is an unfeeling, hateful bitch who tries her best to fake the human thing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Notes:  Myralice is the name of the vampire lady's mother, and the hedge-wizard's daughter.  Come up with your own name for the vampire lady.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;All the elves of that tribe, every man, woman, and child, die - the ones in the camp are killed after the PCs and the leaders go off to the mine.  The ones that went with the PCs are killed while the PCs are in the mine.  The Dryads were busy with the werewolf - they were getting the knife he had in his lair.  Once they got it (it's a spoil from someone who tried to kill the werewolf), the Dryads treestrided the whole way.  The werewolf is unaccounted for after the quest, as are his friends.  There may be other tribes in the forest, but the town doesn't know that.  The orc raiders indicate an orc presence in the nearby mountain, and they might invade if they think the elves are weak.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Future threads and other notes:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Other elf tribes, if they exist, may be pissed off at the PCs for accepting money on the thing, or even assume that the PCs killed the tribe for the town.  Elite elf hunters could hunt after the party, etc.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The hedge-wizard may or may not kill himself after learning that his granddaughter was killed.  He's largely harmless, though, if he is upset with the PCs.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Bonus adventure is if the PCs did not properly dispose of the dead elves - they rise again as Vampire Spawn, all of them.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So that's how I would deal with incorporating Vampires into the story if I were DM.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7161322563694424329-9113928405637880317?l=whatsupnil.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/feeds/9113928405637880317/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2009/04/dnd-quest-thread-thing.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/9113928405637880317'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/9113928405637880317'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2009/04/dnd-quest-thread-thing.html' title='DnD quest thread thing.'/><author><name>Nil Athelion</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16996018952758178741</uri><email>featherless@gmail.com</email></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7161322563694424329.post-7684762558066530787</id><published>2009-04-20T01:02:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2009-04-20T01:04:08.433-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Whether weather needs to be weathered.</title><content type='html'>I think that the weather today was good.  Day temperature rose to be on the hot end of T-shirt weather, and night temperature is on the low end of T-shirt weather.  Good for people who wear T-shirts.  Like me.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I guess that next it will become miserably hot during the day, and only be decent during the night.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7161322563694424329-7684762558066530787?l=whatsupnil.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/feeds/7684762558066530787/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2009/04/whether-weather-needs-to-be-weathered.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/7684762558066530787'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/7684762558066530787'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2009/04/whether-weather-needs-to-be-weathered.html' title='Whether weather needs to be weathered.'/><author><name>Nil Athelion</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16996018952758178741</uri><email>featherless@gmail.com</email></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7161322563694424329.post-6608959311821820378</id><published>2009-04-18T21:38:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2009-04-18T21:56:55.658-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Sci-fi.</title><content type='html'>I just realised that I watch a lot of sci-fi - or rather a specific segment of Sci-fi.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Stargate&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Farscape&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Babylon 5&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Andromeda&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Firefly&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I swear their must be a pattern... some traits common to all of them.  I seem to little or no interest in Startrek, or the expanded universe of Star Wars.  But Stargate?  Farscape?

When I saw the game EVE Online, I was very intrigued.  Fly my spaceship around a persistant universe?  How cool is that?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Except it isn't, really.  You don't fly a ship, you tell a ship where to go.  And the game has a variety of Truly Awful features.  A lot of the game is spent mining, training your stats, etc.  Drudge work.  Worse than many other MMORPGs, the training process isn't even fun - it's very much a ProgressQuest sort of grind, where your character's improvement is slow and based on how long you have owned the game.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So screw all that.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is what I want:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I want to fly my spaceship around a persistant universe, interact with Player Characters and Non-Player Characters, carry out interesting quests from both types of players, and goddamn fly.  Have I mentioned flying?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So let's start from the ground up.  Flying.  In Space.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Control scheme is flight simulation.  Inside of a cockpit or with the cam following the ship.  A variable degree of automation, so that newer players can play alright, and the real piloting experts can have as much control as they want, and as their ship can preform.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I am an advocate of a full &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(mechanics)"&gt;six degrees of freedom&lt;/a&gt; for manuverable ships, though obviously crappy ships or huge ships would have a lessened number of degrees. 2.5 degrees seems to be the least needed - Yaw, pitch, and thrust (which is half of the forward backwards acceleration).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Fighter battles when every ship can accelerate right, left, up, down, forward, and backwards, as well as turning left, right, up, down, and rolling left or right... it will be fun.  Obviously some thrusters will be more powerful than others, and some tools and weapons will be mounting on one part of the ship, not others, but... yeah.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Physics scheme.  EN Nova gets points for how ships fly - rockets and gyros.  Your controls consist of turning, and firing the engine.  To slow down, you spin around and accelerate in the opposite direction.  It's not like you are flying through a fluid atmosphere - you are in space, and an object in motion remains in motion.  This may take some getting used to, but I'm sure that players can catch on.  Think Bablyon 5.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Of course, there's dumb things in B5's flight as well.  Maximum speed, for instance.  Most space probes have thrusters that provide a fraction of an ounce of force.  But there's nothing slowing them down, so they just go faster and faster.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Of course, there are restrictions for game-play to make sense.  First, acceleration is of major importance for spacecraft flying like this.  If all craft had fuel-efficient drives and provided a ounce of pressure for a year to build up decent speeds, what kind of space battles would that provide?  But if they had insane acceleration, the kind that makes flying interesting, then they could accelerate and keep accelerating, and go at a pretty insane speed.  With a few tweaks, it can be balanced:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Fuel:  Acceleration costs fuel.  This can be bought cheaply at a space station, an orbital dock or planetside(atmospheric capable only, costing some to go down).  This means that while the fastest way to travel sub-light is to spend half the trip accelerating and half the trip deaccelerating, but the cheapest way to travel would be spending a fraction of a second accelerating, drifting for a long, long time, and then spending a fraction of a second de-accelerating.  Or hell, just let the docking bay arms grab you, you are moving so slow.  Most people will pick somewhere in the middle, but trade-offs are never bad for game balance.  (In fact, if a choice has a right answer, it shouldn't be a choice.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Shielding:  It's mostly true that there is nothing slowing you down in space.   Mostly.  But the faster you go, the more dangerous objects in space can be.  The faster you fly through, say, a gas cloud, the more damage your shields will take.  Plow into an astroid belt, and you better hope you have some mighty ship with incredibly powerful shields... or you can slow down a bit and dodge all the astroids, should you be piloting something more fragile.  ...or not slow down that much, and have a hell of a time saying in one piece.  This opens all kinds of scenarios, what with most planets having some degree of gas surrounding it, the existence of nebulae, astroid belts, solar flares, etc.  Much fun.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Friction:  In direct proportion to the damage being done by impacting objects, there is a degree of friction.  Traveling through a gas cloud will slow you down a lot if you are going really fast, but the effect is less noticeable at lower speeds, and while theoretically it will bring you to the same speed as the surrounding cloud, in practice it will take a long, long, boring while.  (Good if you run out of fuel, have no generator, and need to be picked up.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Relative motion:  Actually not really so much a fix as an observation:  If you are moving at 600 km/s, and I move at 600.001 km/s , I'm only going one kph faster than you.  And since I don't have to be running my engines to keep moving, the two of us could have an entire dogfight while both of us continued hurdling towards our destination.  To the two of us, the 600 km/s velocity in some direction doesn't matter much at all, only our speed relative to each other.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Relative motion2:  Don't forget that not everything is moving at 600 km/s with you.  If you are too busy dogfighting and don't notice your stop coming up, you'll probably wind up making a nasty fireball in the night sky, or having the spacestation tractor drones pull you off-course to avoid collision.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Other parts about the physics scheme:  Gravity.  Yes, you are in space.  Yes, gravity exists in space.  Yes, that means that space is warped.  Yes, that means that planets orbit suns, yes that means that moons and space stations orbit planets.  And yes, that means you should get in an orbit unless you want to spend your time thrustering upwards according to the strength ofthe local gravity.  Match your speed with your planet, match it with the orbital platform... at least the means of interstellar travel have matches you to the net velocity of any gravity well you reappear in.  Of course, if you have a good sense for these, things, you can let gravity work to your advantage, just imputing a certain velocity and letting other things do the work.  If you do, go sell that information.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Again, everything is relative - if you are in the same orbit as a orbital platform, then both of you would be relatively weightless.  Move out of the orbit, and you're going to be messed with to a good degree.  Makes flying interesting, especially if you turn off the automated features.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Of course, some bits of physics will have to be ignored.  Time dilation, for instance, if anyone chooses to fly that fast through very, very empty space.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Movement is not just within a star system, however, as what's the fun if there are only a number of planets, space stations, and a single star?  What about all the other cool phenomina out there?  But the distance between stars that have interesting debris around them (any type of planet, planetoids, useable gas, or anything else that provides a reason for people to go there) is pretty extreme.  So faster-than-light travel is something nifty, especially since relativistic travel makes for messy time questions.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My proposal is to use Second August's system of FTL travel (SA was a forum-based RPG game/setting I made with Celiana).  Ships move from real space to a sort of lower-energy, more delicate version of our space - infraspace, let's call it.  Ships power down (any velocity, no acceleration), and slip into infraspace.  They turn back on again, and flight through infraspace to their destination.  Infraspace is affected by the real world, and gravitational effects bend space much more than normally is the case, leaving slow-moving wakes, ripples and crunched spots.  Infraspace is highly non-euclidian, and ships use that to their advantage by simply flying through the most compressed areas, reducing the distance traveled.  Additionally, ships systems are much more powerful relative to the physical laws of the alternative realm - this is part of the reason ships power down - the different physical laws can cause energized parts of the ship to surge destructively, blowing out capacitors, etc.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Organized races can modify the delicate infra-space.  While a smart and diligent pilot can navigate the moving gravity distortions to his or her advantage, this is not neccesary for travel on the major space lanes.  What governments (or corporations, even) do is plant small space stations that project a false mass.  Inside of infraspace, each station provides a point of crushed space (gravity hole), and compresses the corresponding infraspace.  Strings of these stations provide roadways of compressed space, plus plenty of gravity holes to leave infraspace.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Which reminds me:  Gravity holes.  When a realspace object weighs enough, it's reflection in the corresponding infraspace doesn't just bend space, it punches a hole in it, similar to a realspace black hole (which makes for quite the distortion in infraspace, btw).  Though gravity itself does not exist in infraspace, the degree of distortion allows infra-space ships to exit infraspace into real space (which is part of why infra-space is so empty - it takes work to get in, but you can just wander out).  Note that space is highly compressed around the hole, and the actual hole - a point in space that is infinitely compressed - corresponds to a large portion of the entire gravity well.  Entering the hole pops you out to the nearest corresponding bit of realspace - the edge of the gravity well where gravity is strong enough to entirely punch through infraspace.  Game mechanic-wise, this means that people cannot drop to subspace within a gravity well, and people cannot emerge in non-safe objects, as whatever makes an area non-safe generally (always, in the game, because we can) provides enough of a gravity well to have people arrive on the periphery.  Note that super-massive objects like black holes and blue giants would have you arrive a distance away where the gravity is no stronger or weaker than arriving at a rogue planetoid (though the distance would differ extremely).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Weapons are next, because they are fun.  There are three types of weapons: instantaneous (IW), unguided(UGW), and guided(GW).  Lasers are instantaneous - you fire a laser pointed at a target, and it hits there immediately, albeit warped by gravitic distortions (especially in subspace).  Tractor beams and several other technologies fall under this catagory.  Unguided weapons (U are fired where a ship will be, on an intercept course, and there is an appreciable delay between it being fired and when it arrives on the target.    UGWs start motion relative to the weapons platform(ship, station, drone, etc), and have a fixed velocity relative to the gun.  Railguns and gauss cannons fall are the faster end of this catagory, while flak cannons are slow to the point of being used as area denial weapons.  Guided weapons are those such as missiles, magnetic grappling hooks, and anything with the ability to follow a craft.  Launched similarly to UGWs, GWs possess homing capabilities.  An important facet of this is that the launcher does not need to be facing its target or its target's projected location when it fires, and better missiles can avoid obstacles, thus not needing line-of-sight.  They also can be intercepted or jammed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Drones are a special case - they are guided, similar to missiles, but instead of ramming into the target, they follow it and fire other kinds of ordinance - IWs and (U)GWs.  A tractor drone falls under this catagory, as does a ion device and most weaponry that would not function if it ran into something.  Mass-impact weapons also benefit if the drone is attacking a fleeing enemy - see below.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Damage types also differ.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Mass impact damage (MID) has to do with the relative velocity of the (U)GW and the victim ship - in essence it is no different than the normal problems of moving fast, save that the object may be more damaging for the amount of speed you run into it.  Effects physical defenses more than energy defenses, though may penetrate energy defenses and hit physical defenses instead.  MIDs generally have an effect on the velocity of the victim ship.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Payload damage (PD) is damage from an explosive or otherwise damaging payload - this is dealt regardless of velocity.  Most missile weapons deal a combination of MID and PD, the proportions of which are dependant on relative speeds of missile and target.  A missile filled with sensor sludge is really meant to cover and jam sensors, but if you fly directly into it at high velocity...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Energy damage (ED) is mostly from IWs, and operates independent of velocity.  Affects energy defenses more than physical defenses, in general.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Outside of that basic framework (which could be expanded) many weapons have specific effects - one IW might try to drain the shield battery, while another may overload it temporatily, and another might be a way to hack the target's systems from a range to prepare for boarding.  Some drones could act as mines, and the poor man may fly backwards at the launching speed of his UGW to lay them as an evironmental hazard.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Movement upgrades are relatively specific for each ship, but generally involve thrusters for acceleration for rotation, grappling hooks for hitchhiking, gyros for rotation, etc.  Note that each upgrade may only affect certain aspects of a ship's preformance - they might improve main thrusters but not strafing thrusters.  Movement upgrades fall under the general category of upgrades.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;One of the main thrusts of the game is buying new and inventive upgrades for your ship.  All manner of improvements are possible, limited only by your wallet and the amount of weight you are willing to carry (the heavier you are, the harder it is to accelerate along any of the six degrees of freedom), and the usage requirements of the upgrade (tractor beams take energy, for instance, while magnetic grapples are lighter and do not, but have their own problems).  General philosophy is that there is not a right choice and a wrong choice, just different choices - everything is a trade-off.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Another main facet of the game is manning a ship.  Larger ships involve far more than a single pilot can manage.  By default, many tasks are taken care of by automation, but a free downloadable cilent should allow non-paying customers to pose as volunteer gunners, communication specialists, Remote-controlled strike-craft pilots, etc.  Thus a player might invite his friends over for a online party where everyone mans parts of his crusier.  This promotes the game, and makes it more fun for everyone.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you don't have friends willing to volunteer, you can put out requests for whatever position is required, along with a salary, on the BBS of a station.  Players sign up, and you can view their history, achievements, and reviews, and then pay some lucky soul some money to (hopefully) man a gun better than the computer... and review them later on how they did.  Or save costs and not buy an automatic gun, and hire some cheap goon to man the gun every time.  Actual players can also drive other ships that you own - if you buy a large enough ship with a docking bay, other ships you own that are small enough can be launched on a hiring basis (plus hired help you might buy can repair and refuel in your docking bay).  More on player interactions later.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Players start with very little.  Instead of buying a ship outright (they could buy a crappy one...) players can get into the action immediately by renting good ships and performing missions to pay the rent on the ship, or being hired to fly a ship by someone else - PC or NPC.  Escort missions are frequent, as pirates(including other players) may attack trade ships if they are not protected - setting a gravity mine in realspace to create a gravity hole to pull trade ships out of subspace and into combat until they can escape the temporary gravity well.  On the shady end of things, assault missions also exist.  Before each mission, the player may choose whether the mission will appear on his or her history.  Marked missions provide prestige and a good resume, but failure or unscrupleous jobs also show up.  Unmarked missions aren't recorded, but you still can get paid or otherwise profit.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Eventually, the player can get enough money to buy his or her own ship, and between flying their ship and flying in other ships, continue to get money to improve their own ship, until that becomes the primary financial source.  The point is to make improvement matter, but also to make improvement fun.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ships dock, of course - you can land in space stations, orbital platforms (w/ or w/o space elevators to a main station and planet), and on planets (depending on habitation, facilities, ship, etc.)  If your ship is too massive to actually dock in/at the facility in question, you can park it in orbit / in space and fly a smaller ship to the station (if you don't have a smaller ship by that time, you can probably hire one).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Once docked, the player can communicate with the shops, read the E-boards for jobs, etc.  Alternatively, the player can go into the station.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Inside the station, or planetside, the player has a customizable avatar and can interact with other PCs in the facility.  Stereotypical facilities exist, though player requests and usage can cause expansions.  Voice channels exist, as well as text channels.  Rentable quiet rooms for explaining missions in precise terms also exist.  Depending on usage and profits, stations or planet-side facilities can expand, as explained on AI behavior.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Enough chatter for now.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1'

late.  Why?  Because I dropped the 9:40-10:30 MWF class, and my first class on Friday is now at 12:55pm.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Yay!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So this morning I hear my phone go off.  My phone is generally my alarm clock, so I grabbed it and opened it up, and... it was not my alarm!  In fact, it was my lady love.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Of course, I have no reception in my bunk.  It's a metal bunk in a concrete building, with two walls being the least seperating me from the outside of the building in any direction.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I noticed that the time was no 11:59, when I set my alarm for, but rather it was 9:35am.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My lady-love called again, and managed to tell me (over the horrible reception on--as I found later--both our ends) that I had class at 9:40am.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I wanted to burst out laughing, hug the lovely lady, and scream all at the same time.  Did not want to get up early, you know, but on the other hand she was so concerned about me not missing my class that she called me.  For a class I no longer have, but it was still a tremendously sweet gesture.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br

post:&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As you probably know, I've been relatively iffy about Obama.  Not so much that he's going to do a horrible job, but rather that people seem to think that now that Obama is in office, things will get better.  But I don't really see the change that much.  "Change you can believe in" was one of the slogans, and I guess I never believe.  I just watch and see.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Well, last Thursday in my Global Career Development class, we had a presentation by this Foreign Service lady.  Of of the questions we asked her at the end was: "How much does your job change between administrations?"&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The answer was that generally speaking, foreign policy stays the same between administrations, with an exception recently.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The ways things have actually changed?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1) The Bad Bush Effect.  First she told us that during the Bush administration, things got harder.  Originally, people loved Americans.  As a diplomat, people would be like: "We think you're wrong, but we like you and your country because you're American."  That stopped during the Bush administration, particularly after the start of the Iraq war.  "We think you're wrong, and we don't like you or your country because you're American."&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I can personally vouch for this one, on reflection.  As you probably know, I've been traveling since before I was 1.  My first birthday was in Australia, and that was on the return end of traveling through China, my dad teaching in Helsinki, etc.  Grew up all my life traveling.  And people liked Americans.  The soft power was there, and damnit, it helped.  Americans were cool, people wanted to be like Americans (I always had mixed feelings about that last one).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As I turned into a teenager, that sense faded.  I always assumed it was me, some sort of nostalgia, but maybe not?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Anyway, Bush made diplomacy difficult, and while the elites generally knew better than to assume most US folks were like Bush, the foreign service had to really drive the public publicity that they try at.  Stuff so that people get to know normal americans.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the mean time, they probably wished they could wear shirts like &lt;a href="http://www.cafepress.com/americanapology/137430"&gt;this.&lt;/a&gt; (By the end of the talk, I got the feeling that the Foreign Service had pretty legitimate reasons to be pissed at Bush.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2)  She also noted climate change policy problems.  The Bush administration's views on climate change were widely variant from the global norm.  It's kind of tricky to talk with people about anything that is affected by climate concerns when, to your goverment, climate concerns don't exist.  How do you make a treaty on industrial pollution standards when the US and the rest of the world are working from a different base of assumptions?  (Yet another reasons for them to think that US folks are stupid.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3) Abortion too.  According to Bush administration policies, federal government institutions were not allowed to provide funding to any health organization, governmental or not, that includes abortion as a possibility in their their health-control schema.  Which seems like a nasty jab at abortion - good if you are anti-choice, bad if you are anti-life (because I like being negative).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The problem in practice is that most governments only have one department of health, and that does everything.  So instead of cutting out the programs that provide the option of abortion in favor of those who don't provide that as an option, the policy wound up cutting the health programs of entire developing countries out of US funding.  And gods do some developing countries need adequately funded health programs. (Another reason for them to think that US folks are dicks.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So, now with the change to Obama, the US has a fresh new face abroad, is now on the same page as everyone else for climate change, and can fund the health programs of developing worlds.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I haven't travelled abroad since Obama was elected.  I hope to see some change.  At least the foreign service gal did.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1'

economics class after break.  The Thursday before break, we had an exam, which I figured I did so-so on.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Yesterday, while we were waiting for class to start (with me diligently working on my knit scarf), we were talking about grades we got, or would get when he passed back the exam.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The fellow to my forwards right got a 38/50, and was pleased.  He figured that the curve would help him out a lot.  The lady behind me got a 32/50 and was less pleased.  The guy on her left got a 39/50, and got some dirty looks.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I, of course, had not checked the online grade posting - for me, once the test is turned in, the grade is going to be the same, so I have no hurry to figure out what it is.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I was sort of worried, though - the test had been a lot harder than I expected - I had little to no trouble with the practice exam from the fall semester, but the exam this time had a lot of questions about elasticity, which I hadn't studied very well for.  (Actually, I hadn't studied much at all - only skimmed the textbook, etc.  But I didn't know it very well, at any rate.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;He started passing out exams.  The guy behind me got a 22/50.  I was worried.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I got a 44/50.  I was impressed.  I figured that I would get around a 39/50, being smart and all that.  I was sort of worried, though - the class is graded on a curve, after all, and so the higher my score, the more true reason people have to be unhappy/jealous.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And then once all the papers had been passed out, Dr. Wang was going to write the top and lowest scores on the board.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Wang: "Wilford, what did you get on the exam?"&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Me: "44?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Wang (to class): "The highest score was 44, the lowest was something like 16 or 18."&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Me: *blushes*&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So yeah.  Apparently I didn't just do okay, I actually set the curve.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;First time I've ever done that.   Mixed feelings between pride and superiority, and embarassment and cringing.  The other students weren't that mad, but they did give me dirty looks occasionally.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We went over the exam in class, and they argued some of the questions.  I was pondering helping them argue for the questions - Lowering my grade to be more on par with the other high-scoring students would not hurt me at all, and would help everybody else.  Eventually I didn't, though - the professor's policy was that people could talk to him privately about it if they cared about points.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I missed two questions, each -2 points, and I got 3/5s credit on one of the essay questions.  I could have easily argued the essay question, but... what's the point.  Setting the curve is an odd situation to be in, apparently.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Anyway, this might lead to the first time I get a A+ in a college class.  I've always been a A-/B+ student, traditionally.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br

Solar Empire</title><content type='html'>Well, I up and bought it.  I don't have a computer that can run it, or really the time to play it, but I bought a license to play it via the &lt;a href="http://www.impulsedriven.com/"&gt;Impulse&lt;/a&gt; digital content distribution system, and downloaded it onto my roommates compter (with permission).  It runs okay on his computer, though I can't max out the prettiness.  I do enough the prettiness.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;According to the Impulse license FAQ, I get to download it from my Impulse account and play it on whatever computer I want, though only one downloaded version can exist at a time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Need to play Tim.  He has it on his laptop.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;While on the topic of Sins, I've played exactly one game on my roommate's computer.  It was a 1vs1 on Fertile Crescent (a slower map) against a Hard Computer (random personality).  I'm guessing it took about two and a half hours, over the course of two days.  Here's a brief summary of what happened:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I had been reading online about various capital ships.  I normally pick the Marza Dreadnought because of it's absurd DPS, planet bombing abilities, and it's amazing ultimate ability, which deals 150 damage 20 times to all enemy ships in the area (affected by shield mitigation, so effectively "only" about 1500).  It's pretty tough, too - the TEC builds ships like that.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;However, the stuff that I was reading, while agreeing about the Marza's awesomeness, also reccomended the TEC's &lt;a href="http://sinsofasolarempire.wikia.com/wiki/Kol_Battleship"&gt;Kol Battleship&lt;/a&gt;.  Why?  Not because of its offensive power, but for it's balanced abilities and amazing defense.  Without abilites, it is statistically the toughest capital ship in the game.  It starts with a clean 3000 HP and enough armor to make it effectively 3750 HP... but better with regeneration.  Decent shields.  It has a a direct offensive ability, an anti-fighter-craft ability, and a defensive ability.  It's ultimate ability does not ravage fleets like the Marza's, but gives it good regeneration in HP and shields.  Gives its attacks splash damage, and decreases cooldown time on special abilities.  Lastly, it increases antimatter regeneration.  If you weren't spamming the special abilities during Finest Hour (its ultimate), you would not only generate antimatter to recoup the cost of using Finest Hour, you would also gain a net 150 antimatter.  It seemed pretty decent, though I felt I would miss blowing up everything with my Marza.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So I started with the Kol, and scouted out the three unknown planets from my start.  Immediately sent the Kol at the astroid, and it ripped appart the native defenders there.  Colonized that, sent the Kol (again, by itself) to the next planet over, which happened to be moderately defended.  Turns out?  Kol doesn't kill things fast.  It just sat there, dealt damage, and got hit a bunch.  I had chosen the defensive ability early, so periodically it would take 15% less damage.  I had heard good things about it, but 15% before mitigation doesn't seem that amazing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Well, apparently it does work.  The Kol nearly single-handedly cleared the system of it's defenders, and I went and colonized that planet.  I then checked the damage on the Kol...  It still had about 1700 HP left.  The thing is like a friggen rock.  I sent it to the next planet, now with back-up, and I cleared that as well, then colonized it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I was happy - my initial push had seized two out of the three planets on the crescent, and so now I had enconomic superiority.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Then the oppnent arrived at the central star system, and started the battle that lasted, on and off, for nearly 2 hours.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My Kol was still pretty hurt from defeating the planet's defenders, and the planetary defenses were in the process of being built when they arrived.  And by they, I mean bunches.  I had about 3 missile frigates and my Kol.  They had&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; a &lt;a href="http://sinsofasolarempire.wikia.com/wiki/Vulkoras_Desolator"&gt;Vulkoras Desolator&lt;/a&gt;, 7 of the Varsari's version of the missile frigate (which is more expensive, but better), and 10 or so light frigates.  My LRM (long range missile frigates) do great damage against the light frigates, but my main concern was beating down their LRMs to slow the offensive power of their army until the planetary defenses were online, and the rest of my fleet returned (I had sent them to conquer a planet while the three LRMs and the Kol sat on the central planet, backed up by the planetary defenses).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"   style="  line-height: 19px; font-family:-webkit-sans-serif;font-size:24px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Unfortunately for me, they soon warped in planet bombers, and started trying to destroy my colony on the central planet.  With no colony, the constrution of planetary defenses would halt, and my delaying tactics would be for naught.  I focused my remaining LRMs (which were going down fast) on the &lt;a href="http://sinsofasolarempire.wikia.com/wiki/Karrastra_Destructor"&gt;Karrastra Destructors&lt;/a&gt; and took them down.  Unfortunately for me, my Kol was going down in health, and they were destroying the defense structures as they were being built.  Eventually, though, I did manage to get a repair bay online, and that repaired my Kol  (the LRMs were long dead at this point).  Now faced with a 2000 or so HP Kol, two gauss gun defense platforms (admitedly at half health) and a repair bay, they decided to flee.  I suddenly realized that their capital ship, despite arriving with more health than mine, was down to about 1000 HP.  I didn't have enough offense to focus on finishing it, but it ran away anyway.  My holdings were safe.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And then they came back.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Joining their damaged Desolator was another capital ship,&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; the Jarrasul Evacutor - &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"   style="  line-height: 19px; font-family:-webkit-sans-serif;font-size:13px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"   style="  line-height: normal; font-family:Georgia;font-size:16px;"&gt;their colony ship.  They now had about 10 of the Vasari LRM, and 10 of the light frigates.  I fought for a bit, but once the repair platform was gone, I had to flee with my Kol.  The Egg (as it is called) poses as a colony capital ship, but it has two insanely offensive-based abilities.  One-on-one Cap versus Cap battles have the Egg (starting with the offensive ability) win every single time.  In my case, it was a new ship, a level 1 ship compare to my level 3 Kol, but the nano-disassembler reduces my armor by two and deals 30 non-mitigated damage &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;every second&lt;/span&gt; for 20 seconds.  That's 600 damage, no ifs or buts.  If my ship was at two low HP and got hit by that, it wouldn't matter if it ran.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So I ran a bit early, when I was at 1500 HP.  By the time I got out of the gravity well to the next planet (which I had built defenses on), it had been hit by the nano-disassembler and focus fire by most other ships during the armor decrease.  It phase-jumped to safety with literally only 45 HP left.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I sent it to the repair bay in the planet there while my LRM fleet got over to meet up with it.  My LRM fleet, plus the new LRMs I had built at my factory, was about 15 ships, plus my newly-repaired Kol.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Meanwhile, their fleet was ripping appart my defenses, and starting to bomb the planet via the two capital ships.  The Desolator is specialized into planetary bombardment like the Marza is, and so it was going a bit faster than I would like.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When my Kol was nearly repaired, I sent it and the fleet over to the planet.  I ordered the LRMs to destroy their LRMs, and I had my Kol focus on the damaged Desolator.  Meanwhile, while my fleet distracted theirs, I tried to built a repair bay.  Three of them were destroyed before one of them got built.  Meanwhile, my LRMs all died and my Kol stubornly sat there, soaking up damage while chipping away at their much more fragile Desolator.  Their Egg was apparently out of antimatter, as it only hit me with the Nano every now and then, rather than each time the 12 second cool-down finished... which is shorter than the 20 second effect, by the way.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Kol eventually destroyed the Desolator, and the enemy fled against, giving me a brief respite to build a few more repair bays, and reinforce with a few LRMs.  Then they came back with the Egg and their own main battleship, their equivalent of the Kol.  My Kol was at level 4 now, compared to their level 2 egg and level main battleship.  I sat on my repair bays and destroyed their Egg while my LRMs fought their LRMs.  My Kol leveled up to 5 just in time before they sent a number of carrier cruisers into the gravity well under contention.  Meanwhile, I used my resource advantage (I controlled one more planet than them, plus being the TEC) to research my own carriers, and send them out as well, outfited with air superiority craft.  Vasari air is better than TEC air, but mine were cheaper.  More importantly, my last level-up with the Kol had me investing in its Flak Burst, an anti-strikecraft measure.  Unfortunately, while the flak burst rips apparet opposing TEC and Advent strikecraft, both of which are fragile, the Varsari craft had about 85 HP, and could weather the Flak Burst better than most.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Combat went on, with the enemy sending in periodic reinforcements and me sending in the same.  I always had less of an army than my foe, but I had multiple repair bays to repair my ships and each other.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Eventually I researched into repair ships and eventually heavy cruisers, and the repair ships started making life easier.  A bit easier.  My Kol got to level six, and then it started using Finest hour, which, given its negative antimatter cost, was on one third of the time.  (60/180 seconds.  It's actually more like a finest minute).  Very helpful.  After the Kol got to level six, I built a second capital ship, a Marza, and sent that in.  The Marza did it's thing, and I kept my strategy focused on destroying any capital ships they sent at me, using the fact that my capital ships kept getting stronger to provide me with an advantage.   I dealt with their frigates as I could.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My strategy paid off when I got to level six with my Marza, and unleashed its Missile Barrage.  This nearly killed all of their amassed frigates and some of their cruisers, and suddenly the battle was in my favor.  I routed them, and the remains fled to the next system.  Using the momentum of the minute, I sent scouts over to the next planet, and made sure they had no huge fleet of reinforcements there.  They didn't.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;About this time, I realized their plan - while the battle was taking forever, they were building broadcasting units on their planet and building up culture.  Defend it as I might, the central planet would have revolted against me if the culture had converted the population.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I attacked their planet, and destroyed everything I could.  Their fleet fled, but I was fine with that.  I destroyed their colony and their orbital structures, including a broadcasting structure.  I figured out that most of them were in their home planet, where their fleet had to be re-massing for a final defense.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I waited in that planet until my ships were ready to fight again.  Specifically, the repair cruisers had repaired my capital ships, and the four minute cooldown on the Missile Barrage finished.  I then invaded their planet.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Again, they had a larger fleet than me, but once I sent the Marza into the middle of their fleet and used the missile barrage, I was in a much better spot than them.  I destroyed their latest capital ship, destroyed their fleet, and set to work on the orbital structures and the planet.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;From there, it went smoothly.  My economy was much better than the two remaining planets they had, and all that was left was wiping out the remains.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Victory was mine.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So that was the first game I played on my roommate's computer.  Sort of a warm-up game, getting used to his mouse and keyboard and such.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Some real Sins of A Solar Empire will be played later.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I should play against Tim...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I managed to blow up the Desolator, and the rest of their fleet fled back to one of their planets.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1'

place for part of Spring Break, and I did something manly!&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;She was having trouble with her lamp - one of the three heads had a switch that would not twist.  She asked me to fix it with my man-skills, so I fiddled with it.  Didn't work.  I told her that I couldn't do it without tools.  She drags out this thing with More Tools Than In Irish C, and asked if they will help.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I took the bulb-holder out of the lamp, and disassembled the whole socket/switch device.  Figured out what was jammed, put it back together, and it was fixed!  Go me.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Yesterday, I was at my parent's place, and I found that my mother was using Dad's High-tech Laptop for her email and internet surfing.  Had some 20+ tabs open on it two, including at least 5 .pdf files.  I covet my dad's computer because he does not use it and it can run modern games.  Like Sins of a Solar Empire, my favorite RTS.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The reason for her using it was that her own computer had stopped functioning.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So I decided to fix her computer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I pressed the on-off switch.  Nothing happened.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I pulled out the plug, and plugged it into another outlet.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I pressed the on-off switch.

Two blogs, in fact.  Abandoning my old LJ blog.  Seperate from notes.  Not sure why, but I always feel a compulsion to write about how my life is when I right on LJ, rather than just commenting on things that happened.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So maybe here I will just comment on things that happen, not on how my life is going in general.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Logistical information:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is the Lightside blog:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I noticed that Leah has two blogs - one for positive things and one for negative things.  I saw it and I liked it.  I think that the two blog setup will help me avoid every post segwaying into whining about my life, whining about my computer, etc.  The Darkside blog is whatsdownnil.blogspot.com...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Title is temporary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Reference to newspeak, obviously.  Wish I could get Nil to be capitialized, but Newspeak is based off of english, and English doesn't work like that.  Anyway, I'm hunting for a new, better title.  If you have suggestions, tell me.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The names I go by:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Online I go by Nil Athelion, Nillion, Aelaris, and Patience.  Nil Athelion is my full-blown psuedonym; Nillion was when I needed no spaces and more than three letters; Aelaris replaced Nillion, as Nillion is a modification for Nil and I was already going by Aelaris for some purposes; and Patience is my gamer-name, since Nil Athelion is two words, and Aelaris is a pacifistic personality.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Aelaris and Patience are both female.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Aelaris is female because Aelaris the name is based on Aelaris the character (Much as Nil the name is based on Nil the character), and Aelaris has a vivid and remarkably feminine personality.  I used to go around as Aelaris as an alter-ego, and even still I will act differently under the name.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Patience is also female, but that stems mostly from the name.  As a gamer, I tend to be either aggressive as Nil or predatory as Patience.  Nil plays Halo 2 and Super Smash Bros: Melee, Patience places Magic: The Gathering, Chess, Gladius, etc.  Aelaris gets some game-time too, in the sort of games she would be comfortable playing.  Many games force you to be violent, though.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What do call me:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I would prefer not to go by my actual name online, so if you comment, refer to me by Nil, Nil Athelion, Mr. Athelion, etc.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Other names of importance:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;There's a certain Toshi in my life these days.  She is my lover and girlfriend.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The other people will be explained or not explained, as the situation entails.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Happy Reading,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-- Nil Athelion&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7161322563694424329-7753704272532311193?l=whatsupnil.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/feeds/7753704272532311193/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2009/03/that-new-blog-smell.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/7753704272532311193'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/7753704272532311193'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2009/03/that-new-blog-smell.html' title='That new blog smell...'/><author><name>Nil Athelion</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16996018952758178741</uri><email>featherless@gmail.com</email></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7161322563694424329.post-7015203886679225388</id><published>2010-03-12T11:42:59.053-07:00</published><updated>2010-03-12T11:42:59.053-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>Run away, run away, run away!

If you read the post about the space piloting game, you&amp;#39;ll notice that giving 6 degrees of acceleration in a physics-realistic space flight model is only intuitive to physics majors and rocket scientists.  Maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here, most of the mechanics work in the background.  From the player&amp;#39;s perspective, they see an attack where someone puts his or her weight into it... it looks appropriate to pull them off balance.  Fast techs to interrupt slow techs is pretty obvious too.  Pushing the control stick forward to avoid being pushed backwards / stunned by an attack feels right, as does taking more damage to show for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick of game design is that it should be simple to learn, and impossible to perfect.  I&amp;#39;ve got one of those, but this is much closer to the other... compared to the flying game.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml'

I'm as skeptical of Obama now as I was when he was running for president.  "Change we can believe in" is wonderful, but what exactly is the change and should I believe in it?  (I guess I may be ignorant of Obama's policies or at least the policies he wants to put into place, but seriously?  "Change we can believe in"?)&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I respect Obama because he is our president, but I really don't know how much one man can do to create lasting change for the good of the country.

You were supposed to explain how a farmer would utilize the equi-marginal principle, and provide a way to test it.  My test, however, was pretty much part of the definition of the principle - if he had an extra fraction of a dollar, it should be equally needed for any option.  But using part of the definition/method for testing is sort of iffy.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Also, I think part of my winning formula was not reading the book - the teacher teaches differently than the book, and his word goes in class.  I didn't read the book because I felt it would confuse me.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Not sure if this is true for the final.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/3267014362233240075/comments/default/5585027725037457023'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/3267014362233240075/comments/default/5585027725037457023'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2009/03/economics-grade-scores.html?showComment=1237439040000#c5585027725037457023' title=''/><author><name>Nil Athelion</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16996018952758178741</uri><email>Featherless@gmail.com</email></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://whatsupnil.blogspot.com/2009/03/economics-grade-scores.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7161322563694424329.post-3267014362233240075' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7161322563694424329/posts/default/3267014362233240075' type='text/html'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7161322563694424329.post-31147870096607213</id><published>2009-03-18T20:39:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2009-03-18T20:39:41.735-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>Go you, lover.  *hugs*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, argue for the ...</title><content type='html'>Go you, lover.  *hugs*&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Also, argue for the essay question if it's not too late.  If you have the right answer, you should get the question marked accordingly.  If you score too close to everybody else, the curve has no meaning (whether it's a traditional bell curve or just the added points).  They (and you) need the encouragement to study more.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Yeah, it sucks.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;But really, you're all about fairness.  Let them have their grades and learn something from it.  And maybe you should study more, too, eh? :P&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;But congrats.
